everyone at some point in their lives wakes up in the middle of the night with the feeling that they are all alone in the world and that nobody loves them now and that nobody will ever love them and that they will never have a decent nights sleep again and will spend their lives wandering blearily around a loveless landscape hoping desperately that their circumstances will improve but suspecting in their heart of hearts that they will remain unloved forever the best thing to do in these circumstances is to wake somebody else up so that they can feel this way too

fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living its a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope
fantasy is escapist and that is its glory if a soldier is imprisioned by the enemy dont we consider it his duty to escape if we value the freedom of mind and soul if were partisans of liberty then its our plain duty to escape and to take as many people with us as we can
fantasy is hardly an escape from reality its a way of understanding it

for me literacy means freedom for the individual and for society
for me trees have always been the most penetrating preachers i revere them when they live in tribes and families in forests and groves and even more i revere them when they stand alone they are like lonely persons not like hermits who have stolen away out of some weakness but like great solitary men like beethoven and nietzsche in their highest boughs the world rustles their roots rest in infinity but they do not lose themselves there they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only to fulfil themselves according to their own laws to build up their own form to represent themselves nothing is holier nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful strong tree when a tree is cut down and reveals its naked deathwound to the sun one can read its whole history in the luminous inscribed disk of its trunk in the rings of its years its scars all the struggle all the suffering all the sickness all the happiness and prosperity stand truly written the narrow years and the luxurious years the attacks withstood the storms endured and every young farmboy knows that the hardest and noblest wood has the narrowest rings that high on the mountains and in continuing danger the most indestructible the strongest the ideal trees grow

friendship is born at the moment when one man says to another what you too i thought that no one but myself
friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain its not something you learn in school but if you havent learned the meaning of friendship you really havent learned anything
friendship is unnecessary like philosophy like art it has no survival value rather it is one of those things which give value to survival

god alert blackjack yelled its the wine dude
god but life is loneliness despite all the opiates despite the shrill tinsel gaiety of parties with no purpose despite the false grinning faces we all wear and when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul you stop in shock at the words you utter they are so rusty so ugly so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long yes there is joy fulfillment and companionship but the loneliness of the soul in its appalling selfconsciousness is horrible and overpowering

happiness consists in getting enough sleep just that nothing more
happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing i know
happiness is a warm puppy
happiness is having a large loving caring closeknit family in another city
happiness is holding someone in your arms and knowing you hold the whole world
happiness is not something ready made it comes from your own actions
happiness is only real when shared
happiness is something that comes into our lives through doors we dont even remember leaving open
happiness is the consequence of personal effort you fight for it strive for it insist upon it and sometimes even travel around the world looking for it you have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings and once you have achieved a state of happiness you must never become lax about maintaining it you must make a mighty effort to keep swimming upward into that happiness forever to stay afloat on top of it
happiness is when what you think what you say and what you do are in harmony

have you ever lost someone you love and wanted one more conversation one more chance to make up for the time when you thought they would be here forever if so then you know you can go your whole life collecting days and none will outweigh the one you wish you had back

he accused me of being dumbledores man through and through
he allowed himself to be swayed by his conviction that human beings are not born once and for all on the day their mothers give birth to them but that life obliges them over and over again to give birth to themselves
he awoke each morning with the desire to do right to be a good and meaningful person to be as simple as it sounded and as impossible as it actually was happy and during the course of each day his heart would descend from his chest into his stomach by early afternoon he was overcome by the feeling that nothing was right or nothing was right for him and by the desire to be alone by evening he was fulfilled alone in the magnitude of his grief alone in his aimless guilt alone even in his loneliness
he can run faster than severus snape confronted with shampoo
he died not for men but for each man if each man had been the only man made he would have done no less
he felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it
he has achieved success who has lived well laughed often and loved much
he must have known id want to leave you
he never went out without a book under his arm and he often came back with two
he smiled understandinglymuch more than understandingly it was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it that you may come across four or five times in life it facedor seemed to facethe whole eternal world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor it understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that at your best you hoped to convey
he stepped down trying not to look long at her as if she were the sun yet he saw her like the sun even without looking
he thinks hell be remembered as the villain in the story but i forgot to tell him that the villain is usually the person who locks up the maiden and throws away the key he was the one who let me out
he was going to live forever or die in the attempt
he was my mum and dads best friend hes a convicted murderer but hes broken out of wizard prison and hes on the run he likes to keep in touch with me thoughkeep up with my newscheck if im happy
he was the crazy one who had painted himself black and defeated the world
he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how
he who knows all the answers has not been asked all the questions
headline he asked
heard melodies are sweet but those unheard are sweeter
heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth overlying our hard hearts i was better after i had cried than beforemore sorry more aware of my own ingratitude more gentle

here is a lesson in creative writing first rule do not use semicolons they are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing all they do is show youve been to college
heres all you have to know about men and women women are crazy men are stupid and the main reason women are crazy is that men are stupid
heres to the crazy ones the misfits the rebels the troublemakers the round pegs in the square holes the ones who see things differently theyre not fond of rules and they have no respect for the status quo you can quote them disagree with them glorify or vilify them about the only thing you cant do is ignore them because they change things they push the human race forward and while some may see them as the crazy ones we see genius because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do
heres to the kids

history does not always repeat itself sometimes it just yells cant you remember anything i told you and lets fly with a club
history will be kind to me for i intend to write it
hold fast to dreams
holding anger is a poisonit eats you from insidewe think that by hating someone we hurt thembut hatred is a curved bladeand the harm we do to otherswe also do to ourselves
holding eleanors hand was like holding a butterfly or a heartbeat like holding something complete and completely alive
holding people away from you and denying yourself love that doesnt make you strong if anything it makes you weaker because youre doing it out of fear
holey you have the the whole world of earrelated humor before you you go for holey
hop

how many slams in an old screen door depends how loud you shut it how many slices in a bread depends how thin you cut it how much good inside a day depends how good you live em how much love inside a friend depends how much you give em

i am a part of all that i have met
i am always saying glad tove met you to somebody im not at all glad i met if you want to stay alive you have to say that stuff though
i am an excitable person who only understands life lyrically musically in whom feelings are much stronger as reason i am so thirsty for the marvelous that only the marvelous has power over me anything i can not transform into something marvelous i let go reality doesnt impress me i only believe in intoxication in ecstasy and when ordinary life shackles me i escape one way or another no more walls
i am beginning to learn that it is the sweet simple things of life which are the real ones after all
i am both happy and sad at the same time and im still trying to figure out how that could be
i am coming to terms with the fact that loving someone requires a leap of faith and that a soft landing is never guaranteed
i am constantly torn between killing myself and killing everyone around me
i am different not less
i am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination imagination is more important than knowledge knowledge is limited imagination encircles the world
i am free and that is why i am lost
i am free of all prejudice i hate everyone equally
i am glad you are here with me here at the end of all things sam
i am going to take this bucket of water and pour it on the flames of hell and then i am going to use this torch to burn down the gates of paradise so that people will not love god for want of heaven or fear of hell but because he is god
i am good but not an angel i do sin but i am not the devil i am just a small girl in a big world trying to find someone to love
i am haunted by humans
i am lonely yet not everybody will do i dont know why some people fill the gaps and others emphasize my loneliness in reality those who satisfy me are those who simply allow me to live with my idea of them
i am looking for friends what does that mean tame
i am no bird and no net ensnares me i am a free human being with an independent will
i am not afraid of storms for i am learning how to sail my ship
i am not interested in being original i am interested in being true
i am not pretty i am not beautiful i am as radiant as the sun
i am not proud but i am happy and happiness blinds i think more than pride
i am not sure exactly what heaven will be like but i know that when we die and it comes time for god to judge us he will not ask how many good things have you done in your life rather he will ask how much love did you put into what you did
i am not sure that i exist actually i am all the writers that i have read all the people that i have met all the women that i have loved all the cities i have visited
i am not young enough to know everything
i am nothing special of this i am sure i am a common man with common thoughts and ive led a common life there are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten but ive loved another with all my heart and soul and to me this has always been enough
i am only responsible for my own heart you offered yours up for the smashing my darling only a fool would give out such a vital organ
i am selfish i am brave
i am so clever that sometimes i dont understand a single word of what i am saying
i am too fond of reading books to care to write them
i am too intelligent too demanding and too resourceful for anyone to be able to take charge of me entirely no one knows me or loves me completely i have only myself
i am very interested and fascinated how everyone loves each other but no one really likes each other
i became insane with long intervals of horrible sanity
i believe a strong woman may be stronger than a man particularly if she happens to have love in her heart i guess a loving woman is indestructible
i believe in christianity as i believe that the sun has risen not only because i see it but because by it i see everything else
i believe in everything until its disproved so i believe in fairies the myths dragons it all exists even if its in your mind whos to say that dreams and nightmares arent as real as the here and now
i believe in god but not as one thing not as an old man in the sky i believe that what people call god is something in all of us i believe that what jesus and mohammed and buddha and all the rest said was right its just that the translations have gone wrong
i believe that everything happens for a reason people change so that you can learn to let go things go wrong so that you appreciate them when theyre right you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together
i believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge that myth is more potent than history that dreams are more powerful than facts that hope always triumphs over experience that laughter is the only cure for grief and i believe that love is stronger than death
i believe the universe wants to be noticed i think the universe is inprobably biased toward the consciousness that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed and who am i living in the middle of history to tell the universe that itor my observation of itis temporary
i bet you could sometimes find all the mysteries of the universe in someones hand
i came from a real tough neighborhood once a guy pulled a knife on me i knew he wasnt a professional the knife had butter on it
i can be changed by what happens to me but i refuse to be reduced by it
i can believe things that are true and things that arent true and i can believe things where nobody knows if theyre true or not

i can never read all the books i want i can never be all the people i want and live all the lives i want i can never train myself in all the skills i want and why do i want i want to live and feel all the shades tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life and i am horribly limited
i can only note that the past is beautiful because one never realises an emotion at the time it expands later and thus we dont have complete emotions about the present only about the past
i can resist anything except temptation
i can shake off everything as i write my sorrows disappear my courage is reborn
i cannot believe in a god who wants to be praised all the time

i may die young but at least ill die smart

i may not have gone where i intended to go but i think i have ended up where i needed to be

i never change i simply become more myself
i never forget a face but in your case ill be glad to make an exception
i never travel without my diary one should always have something sensational to read in the train
i no longer believed in the idea of soul mates or love at first sight but i was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life if you were lucky you might meet someone who was exactly right for you not because he was perfect or because you were but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together
i nodded looking at rachel with respect you hit the lord of the titans in the eye with a blue plastic hairbrush
i pray because i cant help myself i pray because im helpless i pray because the need flows out of me all the time waking and sleeping it doesnt change god it changes me
i read a book one day and my whole life was changed
i read once that the ancient egyptians had fifty words for sand the eskimos had a hundred words for snow i wish i had a thousand words for love but all that comes to mind is the way you move against me while you sleep there are no words for that
i read so i can live more than one life in more than one place
i realize now that dying is easy living is hard
i realize only one person will be damaged beyond repair if peeta dies me
i refuse to answer that question on the grounds that i dont know the answer
i regret that it takes a life to learn how to live
i restore myself when im alone
i saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story from the tip of every branch like a fat purple fig a wonderful future beckoned and winked one fig was a husband and a happy home and children and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor and another fig was ee gee the amazing editor and another fig was europe and africa and south america and another fig was constantin and socrates and attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions and another fig was an olympic lady crew champion and beyond and above these figs were many more figs i couldnt quite make out i saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree starving to death just because i couldnt make up my mind which of the figs i would choose i wanted each and every one of them but choosing one meant losing all the rest and as i sat there unable to decide the figs began to wrinkle and go black and one by one they plopped to the ground at my feet
i say let the world go to hell but i should always have my tea
i shut my eyes and all the world drops dead
i sit beside the fire and thin
i solemnly swear that i am up to no good
i sought to hear the voice of god and climbed the topmost steeple but god declared go down again i dwell among the people
i speak to everyone in the same way whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university
i spent my life folded between the pages of books
i stood still vision blurring and in that moment i heard my heart break it was a small clean sound like the snapping of a flowers stem
i suffer from girlnextdooritis where the guy is friends with you and thats it
i suppose a fire that burns that bright is not meant to last
i suppose ill have to add the force of gravity to my list of enemies
i suspect the most we can hope for and its no small hope is that we never give up that we never stop giving ourselves permission to try to love and receive love
i suspect the truth is that we are waiting all of us against insurmountable odds for something extraordinary to happen to us
i think god in creating man somewhat overestimated his ability
i think if it is true tha
i think if ive learned anything about friendship its to hang in stay connected fight for them and let them fight for you dont walk away dont be distracted dont be too busy or tired dont take them for granted friends are part of the glue that holds life and faith together powerful stuff
i think that if i ever have kids and they are upset i wont tell them that people are starving in china or anything like that because it wouldnt change the fact that they were upset and even if somebody else has it much worse that doesnt really change the fact that you have what you have
i think that were all mentally ill those of us outside the asylums only hide it a little better and maybe not all that much better after all
i think the reward for conformity is that everyone likes you except yourself
i think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives
i think therefore i am
i think theres just one kind of folks folks
i think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us if the book were reading doesnt wake us up with a blow to the head what are we reading for so that it will make us happy as you write good lord we would be happy precisely if we had no books and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to but we need books that affect us like a disaster that grieve us deeply like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves like being banished into forests far from everyone like a suicide a book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us that is my belief
i think you should be a child for as long as you can i have been successful for 74 years being able to do that
i thought id lie on the floor and writhe in pain for a while he grunted it relaxes me
i took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart i am i am i am
i travel not to go anywhere but to go i travel for travels sake the great affair is to move
i used to believe in forever but forevers too good to be true
i used to dream about escaping my ordinary life but my life was never ordinary i had simply failed to notice how extraordinary it was
i walk around the school hallways and look at the people i look at the teachers and wonder why theyre here if they like their jobs or us and i wonder how smart they were when they were fifteen not in a mean way in a curious way its like looking at all the students and wondering whos had their heart broken that day and how they are able to cope with having three quizzes and a book report due on top of that or wondering who did the heart breaking and wondering why
i wan
i want everyone to meet you youre my favorite person of all time
i want to be in a relationship where you telling me you love me is just a ceremonious validation of what you already show me
i want to grow old without facelifts i want to have the courage to be loyal to the face i have made
i want to see you
i want to stand as close to the edge as i can without going over out on the edge you see all kinds of things you cant see from the center
i want you always to remember me will you remember that i existed and that i stood next to you here like this
i wanted a perfect ending now ive learned the hard way that some poems dont rhyme and some stories dont have a clear beginning middle and end
i wanted a perfect ending now ive learned the hard way that some poems dont rhyme and some stories dont have a clear beginning middle and end life is about not knowing having to change taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing whats going to happen next
i wanted so badly to lie down next to her on the couch to wrap my arms around her and sleep not fuck like in those movies not even have sex just sleep together in the most innocent sense of the phrase but i lacked the courage and she had a boyfriend and i was gawky and she was gorgeous and i was hopelessly boring and she was endlessly fascinating so i walked back to my room and collapsed on the bottom bunk thinking that if people were rain i was drizzle and she was hurricane
i wanted the whole world or nothing
i wanted to tell the book thief many things about beauty and brutality but what could i tell her about those things that she didnt already know i wanted to explain that i am constantly overestimating and underestimating the human racethat rarely do i ever simply estimate it i wanted to ask her how the same thing could be so ugly and so glorious and its words and stories so damning and brilliant
i wanted you to see what real courage is instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand its when you know youre licked before you begin but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what
i was always hungry for love just once i wanted to know what it was like to get my fill of it to be fed so much love i couldnt take any more just once
i was born with an enormous need for affection and a terrible need to give it
i was dead until you found me though i breathed i was sightless though i could see and then you cameand i was awakened
i was never really insane except upon occasions when my heart was touched
i was smiling yesterdayi am smiling today and i will smile tomorrowsimply because life is too short to cry for anything
i was thinking about the first time i ever saw you he said and how after that i couldnt forget you i wanted to but i couldnt stop myself i forced hodge to let me be the one who came to find you and bring you back to the institue and even back then in that stupid coffee shop when i saw you sitting on that couch with simon even then that felt wrong to me i should have been the one sitting with you the one who made you laugh like that i couldnt get rid of that feeling that it should have been me and the more i knew you the more i felt itit had never been like that for me before id always wanted a girl and then gotten to know her and not wanted her anymore but with you the feeling just got stronger and stronger until that night when you showed up at renwicks and i knew
i was wise enough never to grow up while fooling people into believing i had
i was within and without simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life
i wasnt actually in love but i felt a sort of tender curiosity
i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived i did not wish to live what was not life living is so dear nor did i wish to practise resignation unless it was quite necessary i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life to live so sturdily and spartanlike as to put to rout all that was not life to cut a broad swath and shave close to drive life into a corner and reduce it to its lowest terms
i will love you always when this red hair is white i will still love you when the smooth softness of youth is replaced by the delicate softness of age i will still want to touch your skin when your face is full of the lines of every smile you have ever smiled of every surprise i have seen flash through your eyes when every tear you have ever cried has left its mark upon your facei will treasure you all the more because i was there to see it all i will share your life with you meredith and i will love you until the last breath leaves your body or mine
i will not let anyone walk through my mind with their dirty feet
i will not say do not weep for not all tears are an evil
i will remember the kisse
i will take the sun in my mout
i wish i could freeze this moment right here right now and live in it forever
i wish i were a girl again halfsavage and hardy and free
i wish it need not have happened in my time said frodo
i with a deeper instinct choose a man who compels my strength who makes enormous demands on me who does not doubt my courage or my toughness who does not believe me nave or innocent who has the courage to treat me like a woman
i woke up thinking a very pleasant thought there is lots left in the world to read
i wonder how many people dont get the one they want but end up with the one theyre supposed to be with
i wonder how many people ive looked at all my life and never seen
i wonder if the sno
i wont ever leave you even though youre always leaving me

id rather be hated for who i am than loved for who i am not
id rather die my way than live yours

if i read a book and it makes my whole body so cold no fire can ever warm me i know that is poetry
if i should ever die god forbid let this be my epitaph
if i were not a physicist i would probably be a musician i often think in music i live my daydreams in music i see my life in terms of music

keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions small people always do that but the really great make you feel that you too can become great
keep in mind that people change but the past doesnt
keep smiling because life is a beautiful thing and theres so much to smile about
keep your face always toward the sunshine and shadows will fall behind you
kind words can be short and easy to speak but their echoes are truly endless
kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see

laters baby
laugh and the world laughs with you snore and you sleep alone
laugh even when you feel too sick or too worn out or tired
laughter is timeless imagination has no age and dreams are forever
laughter is wine for the soul laughter soft or loud and deep tinged through with seriousness the hilarious declaration made by man that life is worth living
learn from the mistakes of others you can never live long enough to make them all yourself
learn the rules break the rules make up new rules break the new rules
learn to value yourself which means fight for your happiness
learn what is to be taken seriously and laugh at the rest
learning to ignore things is one of the great paths to inner peace
let everything happen to yo

let the rain kiss you let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops let the rain sing you a lullaby
let there be spaces in your togetherness and let the winds of the heavens dance between you love one another but make not a bond of love let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls fill each others cup but drink not from one cup give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf sing and dance together and be joyous but let each one of you be alone even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music give your hearts but not into each others keeping for only the hand of life can contain your hearts and stand together yet not too near together for the pillars of the temple stand apart and the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each others shadow
let us be grateful to the people who make us happy they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom
let us find the dam snack bar zoe said we should eat while we can
let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead

life becomes easier and more beautiful when we can see the good in other people

life is not a matter of holding good cards but of playing a poor hand well
life is pain highness anyone who says differently is selling something
life is to be enjoyed not endured
life is too short to waste any amount of time on wondering what other people think about you in the first place if they had better things going on in their lives they wouldnt have the time to sit around and talk about you whats important to me is not others opinions of me but whats important to me is my opinion of myself
life is what happens to us while we are making other plans
life isnt about finding yourself life is about creating yourself
life isnt finding shelter in the storm its about learning to dance in the rain
life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
life shrinks or expands in proportion to ones courage
life will break you nobody can protect you from that and living alone wont either for solitude will also break you with its yearning you have to love you have to feel it is the reason you are here on earth you are here to risk your heart you are here to be swallowed up and when it happens that you are broken or betrayed or left or hurt or death brushes near let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps wasting their sweetness tell yourself you tasted as many as you could
lifes under no obligation to give us what we expect

lost opportunities lost possibilities feelings we can never get back thats part of what it means to be alive but inside our heads at least thats where i imagine it theres a little room where we store those memories a room like the stacks in this library and to understand the workings of our own heart we have to keep on making new reference cards we have to dust things off every once in awhile let in fresh air change the water in the flower vases in other words youll live forever in your own private library

love is a temporary madness it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides and when it subsides you have to make a decision you have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part because this is what love is love is not breathlessness it is not excitement it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body no dont blush i am telling you some truths that is just being in love which any fool can do love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away and this is both an art and a fortunate accident

love is like the wind you cant see it but you can feel it
love is needing someone love is putting up with someones bad qualities because they somehow complete you
love is not affectionate feeling but a steady wish for the loved persons ultimate good as far as it can be obtained

make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may previously never have thought of doing or been too hesitant to attempt so many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security conformity and conservation all of which may appear to give one peace of mind but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future the very basic core of a mans living spirit is his passion for adventure the joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon for each day to have a new and different sun if you want to get more out of life you must lose your inclination for monotonous security and adopt a helterskelter style of life that will at first appear to you to be crazy but once you become accustomed to such a life you will see its full meaning and its incredible beauty

she was the heir of ash and fire and she would bow to no one
she wasnt bitter she was sad though but it was a hopeful kind of sad the kind of sad that just takes time

war must be while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all but i do not love the bright sword for its sharpness nor the arrow for its swiftness nor the warrior for his glory i love only that which they defend
was it hard i ask
watch out for intellect
we accept the love we think we deserve
we all bear scars mine just happen to be more visible than most
we all die the goal isnt to live forever the goal is to create something that will
we all have our time machines dont we those that take us back are memoriesand those that carry us forward are dreams
we are addicted to our thoughts we cannot change anything if we cannot change our thinking
we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in some of us just go one god further
we are all born mad some remain so
we are all born sexual creaturesthank god but its a pity so many people despise and crush this natural gift
we are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars
we are always the same age inside
we are cups constantly and quietly being filled the trick is knowing how to tip ourselves over and let the beautiful stuff out
we are each our own devil and we make this world our hell
we are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star but we can understand the universe that makes us something very special
we are not necessarily doubting that god will do the best for us we are wondering how painful the best will turn out to be
we are only as strong as we are united as weak as we are divided
we are surrounded by story
we are the music makers and we are the dreamers of dreams
we are what we pretend to be so we must be careful about what we pretend to be
we believe in ordinary acts of bravery in the courage that drives one person to stand up for another
we both have war inside us sometimes it keeps us alive sometimes it threatens to destroy us
we came to see jace is he alright
we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
we can know only that we know nothing and that is the highest degree of human wisdom
we can never judge the lives of others because each person knows only their own pain and renunciation its one thing to feel that you are on the right path but its another to think that yours is the only path
we cant be afraid of change you may feel very secure in the pond that you are in but if you never venture out of it you will never know that there is such a thing as an ocean a sea holding onto something that is good for you now may be the very reason why you dont have something better
we delight in the beauty of the butterfly but rarely admit the changes it has gone through to achieve that beauty
we didnt talk about anything heavy or light we were just there together and that was enough
we do not believe in ourselves until someone reveals that deep inside us something is valuable worth listening to worthy of our trust sacred to our touch once we believe in ourselves we can risk curiosity wonder spontaneous delight or any experience that reveals the human spirit
we do not grow absolutely chronologically we grow sometimes in one dimension and not in another unevenly we grow partially we are relative we are mature in one realm childish in another the past present and future mingle and pull us backward forward or fix us in the present we are made up of layers cells constellations
we do not need magic to transform our world we carry all of the power we need inside ourselves already
we do not need magic to transform our world we carry all the power we need inside ourselves already
we dont see things as they are we see them as we are
we dream in our waking moments and walk in our sleep
we fell in love despite our differences and once we did something rare and beautiful was created for me love like that has only happened once and thats why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory ill never forget a single moment of it
we have to allow ourselves to be loved by the people who really love us the people who really matter too much of the time we are blinded by our own pursuits of people to love us people that dont even matter while all that time we waste and the people who do love us have to stand on the sidewalk and watch us beg in the streets its time to put an end to this its time for us to let ourselves be loved
we have to continually be jumping off cliffs and developing our wings on the way down
we have to dare to be ourselves however frightening or strange that self may prove to be
we know what we are but not what we may be
we live and breathe words it was books that made me feel that perhaps i was not completely alone they could be honest with me and i with them reading your words what you wrote how you were lonely sometimes and afraid but always brave the way you saw the world its colors and textures and sounds i felti felt the way you thought hoped felt dreamt i felt i was dreaming and thinking and feelin
we live for books
we love the things we love for what they are
we loved with a love that was more than love
we must be willing to let go of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us
we need in love to practice only this letting each other go for holding on comes easily we do not need to learn it
we need not to be let alone we need to be really bothered once in a while how long is it since you were really bothered about something important about something real
we need to talk all of us about what were going to do now
we read to know were not alone
we should all start to live before we get too old fear is stupid so are regrets
we should consider every day lost on which we have not danced at least once
we shouldnt be looking for heroes we should be looking for good ideas
we sit silently and watch the world around us this has taken a lifetime to learn it seems only the old are able to sit next to one another and not say anything and still feel content the young brash and impatient must always break the silence it is a waste for silence is pure silence is holy it draws people together because only those who are comfortable with each other can sit without speaking this is the great paradox
we take for granted the very things that most deserve our gratitude
we waste time looking for the perfect lover instead of creating the perfect love
we write to taste life twice in the moment and in retrospect
wed get sick on too many cookies but ever so much sicker on no cookies at all
weeds are flowers too once you get to know them
welcome to the wonderful world of jealousy he thought for the price of admission you get a splitting headache a nearly irresistable urge to commit murder and an inferiority complex yippee
well dont expect us to be too impressed we just saw finnick odair in his underwear
well it seems to me that the best relationships the ones that last are frequently the ones that are rooted in friendship you know one day you look at the person and you see something more than you did the night before like a switch has been flicked somewhere and the person who was just a friend is suddenly the only person you can ever imagine yourself with

what is family they were the people who claimed you in good in bad in parts or in whole they were the ones who showed up who stayed in there regardless it wasnt just about blood relations or shared chromosomes but something wider bigger we had many families over time our family of origin the family we created and the groups you moved through while all of this was happening friends lovers sometimes even strangers none of them perfect and we couldnt expect them to be you cant make any one person your world the trick was to take what each could give you and build your world from it
what is hell i maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love

when adults say teenagers think they are invincible with that sly stupid smile on their faces they dont know how right they are we need never be hopeless because we can never be irreparably broken we think that we are invincible because we are we cannot be born and we cannot die like all energy we can only change shapes and sizes and manifestations they forget that when they get old they get scared of losing and failing but that part of us greater than the sum of our parts cannot begin and cannot end and so it cannot fail
when did we see each other facetoface not until you saw into my cracks and i saw into yours before that we were just looking at ideas of each other like looking at your window shade but never seeing inside but once the vessel cracks the light can get in the light can get out

when i have a little money i buy books and if i have any left i buy food and clothes
when i look at my life and its secret colours i feel like bursting into tears
when i look at my room i see a girl who loves books
when i saw you i fell in love and you smiled because you knew
when i say its you i like im talking about that part of you that knows that life is far more than anything you can ever see or hear or touch that deep part of you that allows you to stand for those things without which humankind cannot survive love that conquers hate peace that rises triumphant over war and justice that proves more powerful than greed

when we are no longer able to change a situation we are challenged to change ourselves
when we are tired we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago
when we are young the words are scattered all around us as they are assembled by experience so also are we sentence by sentence until the story takes shape
when we dont know who to hate we hate ourselves
when we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives mean the most to us we often find that it is those who instead of giving advice solutions or cures have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand the friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement who can tolerate not knowing not curing not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness that is a friend who cares
when we least expect it life sets us a challenge to test our courage and willingness to change at such a moment there is no point in pretending that nothing has happened or in saying that we are not yet ready the challenge will not wait life does not look back a week is more than enough time for us to decide whether or not to accept our destiny
