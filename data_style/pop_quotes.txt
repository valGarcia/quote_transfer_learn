<bos> do not be afraid our fat <eos>
<bos> do not fall in love with people like me <eos>
<bos> do not fear to be eccentric in opinion for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric <eos>
<bos> do not go gentle into that good night <eos>
<bos> do not go where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave a trail <eos>
<bos> do not let the memories of your past limit the potential of your future there are no limits to what you can achieve on your journey through life except in your mind <eos>
<bos> do not let your fire go out spark by irreplaceable spark in the hopeless swamps of the notquite the notyet and the notatall do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you deserved and have never been able to reach the world you desire can be won it exists it is real it is possible its yours <eos>

<bos> do one thing every day that scares you <eos>
<bos> do what is right not what is easy nor what is popular <eos>
<bos> do what you can with what you have where you are <eos>
<bos> do you hate people <eos>
<bos> do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles is to school an intelligence and make it a soul <eos>

<bos> do you think that i count the days there is only one day left always starting over it is given to us at dawn and taken away from us at dusk <eos>
<bos> do you want to know who you are dont ask act action will delineate and define you <eos>
<bos> do you wish me a good morning or mean that it is a good morning whether i want it or not or that you feel good this morning or that it is a morning to be good on <eos>
<bos> do your little bit of good where you are its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world <eos>
<bos> do your thing and dont care if they like it <eos>
<bos> dogs never bite me just humans <eos>
<bos> dont be afraid of death be afraid of an unlived life you dont have to live forever you just have to live <eos>
<bos> dont be afraid of your fears theyre not there to scare you theyre there to let you know that something is worth it <eos>
<bos> dont be pushed around by the fears in your mind be led by the dreams in your heart <eos>
<bos> dont be satisfied with stories how things have gone with others unfold your own myth <eos>
<bos> dont be so humble you are not that great <eos>
<bos> dont bend dont water it down dont try to make it logical dont edit your own soul according to the fashion rather follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly <eos>
<bos> dont clary raised a warning hand im not really in the mood right now <eos>
<bos> dont compromise yourself youre all you have <eos>
<bos> dont cry because its over smile because it happened <eos>
<bos> dont cry over someone who wouldnt cry over you <eos>
<bos> dont ever apologise to an author for buying something in paperback or taking it out from a library thats what theyre there for <eos>
<bos> dont ever tell anybody anything if you do you start missing everybody <eos>
<bos> dont feel bad im usually about to die <eos>
<bos> dont feel sorry for yourself only assholes do that <eos>
<bos> dont gain the world lose your soul wisdom is better than silver or gold <eos>
<bos> dont give in to your fears if you do you wont be able to talk to your heart <eos>
<bos> dont judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant <eos>
<bos> dont let the bastards grind you down <eos>
<bos> dont let the muggles get you down <eos>

<bos> dont panic <eos>
<bos> dont part with your illusions when they are gone you may still exist but you have ceased to live <eos>
<bos> dont say you dont have enough time you have exactly the same number of hours per day that were given to helen keller pasteur michelangelo mother teresa leonardo da vinci thomas jefferson and albert einstein <eos>
<bos> dont spend time beating on a wall hoping to transform it into a door <eos>
<bos> dont stop there i suppose there are also what vampires and werewolves and zombies <eos>
<bos> dont take life too seriously punch it in the face when it needs a good hit laugh at it <eos>

<bos> dont think of it as dying said death just think of it as leaving early to avoid the rush <eos>
<bos> dont think or judge just listen <eos>
<bos> dont touch any of my weapons without my permission <eos>
<bos> dont wait for a light to appear at the end of the tunnel stride down there and light the bloody thing yourself <eos>
<bos> dont waste your time with explanations people only hear what they want to hear <eos>

<bos> happiness is holding someone in your arms and knowing you hold the whole world <eos>
<bos> happiness is not something ready made it comes from your own actions <eos>
<bos> happiness is only real when shared <eos>
<bos> happiness is something that comes into our lives through doors we dont even remember leaving open <eos>
<bos> happiness is the consequence of personal effort you fight for it strive for it insist upon it and sometimes even travel around the world looking for it you have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings and once you have achieved a state of happiness you must never become lax about maintaining it you must make a mighty effort to keep swimming upward into that happiness forever to stay afloat on top of it <eos>
<bos> happiness is when what you think what you say and what you do are in harmony <eos>

<bos> have you ever lost someone you love and wanted one more conversation one more chance to make up for the time when you thought they would be here forever if so then you know you can go your whole life collecting days and none will outweigh the one you wish you had back <eos>

<bos> humor is reason gone mad <eos>
<bos> i address you all tonight for who you truly are wizards mermaids travelers adventurers and magicians you are the true dreamers <eos>
<bos> i always arrive late at the office but i make up for it by leaving early <eos>
<bos> i always channel my emotions into my work that way i dont hurt anyone but myself <eos>
<bos> i am a badass and i recognize that you too are a badass <eos>
<bos> i am a cage in search of a bird <eos>
<bos> i am a man he told her and men do not consume pink beverages get thee gone woman and bring me something brown <eos>
<bos> i am a part of all that i have met <eos>
<bos> i am always saying glad tove met you to somebody im not at all glad i met if you want to stay alive you have to say that stuff though <eos>
<bos> i am an excitable person who only understands life lyrically musically in whom feelings are much stronger as reason i am so thirsty for the marvelous that only the marvelous has power over me anything i can not transform into something marvelous i let go reality doesnt impress me i only believe in intoxication in ecstasy and when ordinary life shackles me i escape one way or another no more walls <eos>
<bos> i am beginning to learn that it is the sweet simple things of life which are the real ones after all <eos>
<bos> i am both happy and sad at the same time and im still trying to figure out how that could be <eos>
<bos> i am coming to terms with the fact that loving someone requires a leap of faith and that a soft landing is never guaranteed <eos>
<bos> i am constantly torn between killing myself and killing everyone around me <eos>
<bos> i am different not less <eos>
<bos> i am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination imagination is more important than knowledge knowledge is limited imagination encircles the world <eos>
<bos> i am free and that is why i am lost <eos>
<bos> i am free of all prejudice i hate everyone equally <eos>
<bos> i am glad you are here with me here at the end of all things sam <eos>
<bos> i am going to take this bucket of water and pour it on the flames of hell and then i am going to use this torch to burn down the gates of paradise so that people will not love god for want of heaven or fear of hell but because he is god <eos>
<bos> i am good but not an angel i do sin but i am not the devil i am just a small girl in a big world trying to find someone to love <eos>
<bos> i am haunted by humans <eos>
<bos> i am lonely yet not everybody will do i dont know why some people fill the gaps and others emphasize my loneliness in reality those who satisfy me are those who simply allow me to live with my idea of them <eos>
<bos> i am looking for friends what does that mean tame <eos>
<bos> i am no bird and no net ensnares me i am a free human being with an independent will <eos>
<bos> i am not afraid of storms for i am learning how to sail my ship <eos>
<bos> i am not interested in being original i am interested in being true <eos>
<bos> i am not pretty i am not beautiful i am as radiant as the sun <eos>
<bos> i am not proud but i am happy and happiness blinds i think more than pride <eos>
<bos> i am not sure exactly what heaven will be like but i know that when we die and it comes time for god to judge us he will not ask how many good things have you done in your life rather he will ask how much love did you put into what you did <eos>
<bos> i am not sure that i exist actually i am all the writers that i have read all the people that i have met all the women that i have loved all the cities i have visited <eos>
<bos> i am not young enough to know everything <eos>
<bos> i am nothing special of this i am sure i am a common man with common thoughts and ive led a common life there are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten but ive loved another with all my heart and soul and to me this has always been enough <eos>
<bos> i am only responsible for my own heart you offered yours up for the smashing my darling only a fool would give out such a vital organ <eos>
<bos> i am selfish i am brave <eos>
<bos> i am so clever that sometimes i dont understand a single word of what i am saying <eos>
<bos> i am too fond of reading books to care to write them <eos>
<bos> i am too intelligent too demanding and too resourceful for anyone to be able to take charge of me entirely no one knows me or loves me completely i have only myself <eos>
<bos> i am very interested and fascinated how everyone loves each other but no one really likes each other <eos>
<bos> i became insane with long intervals of horrible sanity <eos>
<bos> i believe a strong woman may be stronger than a man particularly if she happens to have love in her heart i guess a loving woman is indestructible <eos>
<bos> i believe in christianity as i believe that the sun has risen not only because i see it but because by it i see everything else <eos>
<bos> i believe in everything until its disproved so i believe in fairies the myths dragons it all exists even if its in your mind whos to say that dreams and nightmares arent as real as the here and now <eos>
<bos> i believe in god but not as one thing not as an old man in the sky i believe that what people call god is something in all of us i believe that what jesus and mohammed and buddha and all the rest said was right its just that the translations have gone wrong <eos>
<bos> i believe that everything happens for a reason people change so that you can learn to let go things go wrong so that you appreciate them when theyre right you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together <eos>
<bos> i believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge that myth is more potent than history that dreams are more powerful than facts that hope always triumphs over experience that laughter is the only cure for grief and i believe that love is stronger than death <eos>
<bos> i believe the universe wants to be noticed i think the universe is inprobably biased toward the consciousness that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed and who am i living in the middle of history to tell the universe that itor my observation of itis temporary <eos>
<bos> i bet you could sometimes find all the mysteries of the universe in someones hand <eos>
<bos> i came from a real tough neighborhood once a guy pulled a knife on me i knew he wasnt a professional the knife had butter on it <eos>
<bos> i can be changed by what happens to me but i refuse to be reduced by it <eos>
<bos> i can believe things that are true and things that arent true and i can believe things where nobody knows if theyre true or not <eos>
<bos> i can feel peeta press his forehead into my temple and he asks so now that youve got me what are you going to do with me i turn into him put you somewhere you cant get hurt <eos>
<bos> i can listen no longer in silence i must speak to you by such means as are within my reach you pierce my soul i am half agony half hope tell me not that i am too late that such precious feelings are gone for ever i offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman that his love has an earlier death i have loved none but you unjust i may have been weak and resentful i have been but never inconstant you alone have brought me to bath for you alone i think and plan have you not seen this can you fail to have understood my wishes i had not waited even these ten days could i have read your feelings as i think you must have penetrated mine i can hardly write i am every instant hearing something which overpowers me you sink your voice but i can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others too good too excellent creature you do us justice indeed you do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men believe it to be most fervent most undeviating in f w <eos>
<bos> i can never read all the books i want i can never be all the people i want and live all the lives i want i can never train myself in all the skills i want and why do i want i want to live and feel all the shades tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life and i am horribly limited <eos>
<bos> i can only note that the past is beautiful because one never realises an emotion at the time it expands later and thus we dont have complete emotions about the present only about the past <eos>
<bos> i can resist anything except temptation <eos>
<bos> i can shake off everything as i write my sorrows disappear my courage is reborn <eos>
<bos> i cannot believe in a god who wants to be praised all the time <eos>
<bos> i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun <eos>
<bos> i cannot go to school today <eos>
<bos> i cannot live without books <eos>
<bos> i cannot remember the books ive read any more than the meals i have eaten even so they have made me <eos>
<bos> i cannot sleep unless i am surrounded by books <eos>
<bos> i cannot teach anybody anything i can only make them think <eos>
<bos> i cant eat and i cant sleep im not doing well in terms of being a functional human you know <eos>
<bos> i cant give you a surefire formula for success but i can give you a formula for failure try to please everybody all the time <eos>
<bos> i cant imagine a man really enjoying a book and reading it only once <eos>
<bos> i carry your heart with me i carry it in my hearti am never without it anywher <eos>
<bos> i clench his hands to the point of pain stay with me <eos>
<bos> i could die for you but i couldnt and wouldnt live for you <eos>
<bos> i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine <eos>
<bos> i could not tell you if i loved you the first moment i saw you or if it was the second or third or fourth but i remember the first moment i looked at you walking toward me and realized that somehow the rest of the world seemed to vanish when i was with you <eos>
<bos> i crave your mouth your voice your hair <eos>
<bos> i decided as long as im going to hell i might as well do it thoroughly <eos>
<bos> i decided it is better to scream silence is the real crime against humanity <eos>
<bos> i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library <eos>
<bos> i desire the things that will destroy me in the end <eos>

<bos> i didnt want to wake up i was having a much better time asleep and thats really sad it was almost like a reverse nightmare like when you wake up from a nightmare youre so relieved i woke up into a nightmare <eos>
<bos> i do not fear death i had been dead for billions and billions of years before i was born and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it <eos>
<bos> i do not think sir you have any right to command me merely because you are older than i or because you have seen more of the world than i have your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience <eos>
<bos> i do not want people to be very agreeable as it saves me the trouble of liking them a great deal <eos>
<bos> i do things like get in a taxi and say the library and step on it <eos>
<bos> i dont believe in the kind of magic in my books but i do believe something very magical can happen when you read a good book <eos>

<bos> i dont go out with strangers i said <eos>
<bos> i dont hate you i just dont like that you exist <eos>
<bos> i dont know half of you half as well as i should like and i like less than half of you half as well as you deserve <eos>
<bos> i dont know that love changes people change circumstances change <eos>
<bos> i dont know the question but sex is definitely the answer <eos>
<bos> i dont know where im going but im on my way <eos>
<bos> i dont know who invented high heels but all women owe him a lot <eos>
<bos> i dont like people who have never fallen or stumbled their virtue is lifeless and it isnt of much value life hasnt revealed its beauty to them <eos>
<bos> i dont mind living in a mans world as long as i can be a woman in it <eos>
<bos> i dont mind making jokes but i dont want to look like one <eos>
<bos> i dont suffer from my insanity i enjoy every minute of it <eos>
<bos> i dont think of all the misery but of the beauty that still remains <eos>
<bos> i dont think there is any truth there are only points of view <eos>
<bos> i dont trust people who dont love themselves and tell me i love you there is an african saying which is be careful when a naked person offers you a shirt <eos>

<bos> i dont want to be a man said jace i want to be an angstridden teenager who cant confront his own inner demons and takes it out verbally on other people instead <eos>
<bos> i dont want to be at the mercy of my emotions i want to use them to enjoy them and to dominate them <eos>
<bos> i dont want to die without any scars <eos>
<bos> i dont want to go to heaven none of my friends are there <eos>
<bos> i dont want to lose the boy with the bread <eos>
<bos> i dont want to repeat my innocence i want the pleasure of losing it again <eos>
<bos> i dream my painting and i paint my dream <eos>
<bos> i dream sometimes i think thats the only right thing to do <eos>
<bos> i drink to make other people more interesting <eos>
<bos> i feel free and strong if i were not a reader of books i could not feel this way <eos>
<bos> i feel like someone breathed new air into my lungs i am not abnegation i am not dauntless <eos>
<bos> i fell in love with her courage her sincerity and her flaming self respect and its these things id believe in even if the whole world indulged in wild suspicions that she wasnt all she should be i love her and it is the beginning of everything <eos>
<bos> i fell in love with her when we were together then fell deeper in love with her in the years we were apart <eos>
<bos> i fell in love with him but i dont just stay with him by default as if theres no one else available to me i stay with him because i choose to every day that i wake up every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other i choose him over and over again and he chooses me <eos>
<bos> i felt like crying but nothing came out it was just a sort of sad sickness sick sad when you cant feel any worse i think you know it i think everybody knows it now and then but i think i have known it pretty often too often <eos>
<bos> i figured all your classes were stuff like slaughter 101 and beheading for beginners <eos>
<bos> i figured something out the future is unpredictable <eos>

<bos> i find television very educating every time somebody turns on the set i go into the other room and read a book <eos>
<bos> i generally avoid temptation unless i cant resist it <eos>
<bos> i get a warm feeling among my books <eos>
<bos> i go to seek a great perhaps <eos>
<bos> i got schooled this yea <eos>
<bos> i guess by now i should know enough about loss to realize that you never really stop missing someoneyou just learn to live around the huge gaping hole of their absence <eos>
<bos> i guess thats what saying goodbye is always likelike jumping off an edge the worst part is making the choice to do it once youre in the air theres nothing you can do but let go <eos>
<bos> i had already found that it was not good to be alone and so made companionship with what there was around me sometimes with the universe and sometimes with my own insignificant self but my books were always my friends let fail all else <eos>
<bos> i hate men who are afraid of womens strength <eos>
<bos> i hate to advocate drugs alcohol violence or insanity to anyone but theyve always worked for me <eos>
<bos> i hate to hear you talk about all women as if they were fine ladies instead of rational creatures none of us want to be in calm waters all our lives <eos>
<bos> i have a history of making decisions very quickly about men i have always fallen in love fast and without measuring risks i have a tendency not only to see the best in everyone but to assume that everyone is emotionally capable of reaching his highest potential i have fallen in love more times than i care to count with the highest potential of a man rather than with the man himself and i have hung on to the relationship for a long time sometimes far too long waiting for the man to ascend to his own greatness many times in romance i have been a victim of my own optimism <eos>
<bos> i have a theory that selflessness and bravery arent all that different <eos>
<bos> i have absolutely no pleasure in the stimulants in which i sometimes so madly indulge it has not been in the pursuit of pleasure that i have periled life and reputation and reason it has been the desperate attempt to escape from torturing memories from a sense of insupportable loneliness and a dread of some strange impending doom <eos>
<bos> i have always imagined that paradise will be a kind of library <eos>
<bos> i have come to accept the feeling of not knowing where i am going and i have trained myself to love it because it is only when we are suspended in midair with no landing in sight that we force our wings to unravel and alas begin our flight and as we fly we still may not know where we are going to but the miracle is in the unfolding of the wings you may not know where youre going but you know that so long as you spread your wings the winds will carry you <eos>
<bos> i have decided to stick to lovehate is too great a burden to bear <eos>
<bos> i have faith that god will show you the answer but you have to understand that sometimes it takes a while to be able to recognize what god wants you to do thats how it often is gods voice is usually nothing more than a whisper and you have to listen very carefully to hear it but other times in those rarest of moments the answer is obvious and rings as loud as a church bell <eos>
<bos> i have found the paradox that if you love until it hurts there can be no more hurt only more love <eos>
<bos> i have great faith in fools selfconfidence my friends will call it <eos>
<bos> i have hated words and i have loved them and i hope i have made them right <eos>
<bos> i have heard there are troubles of more than one kind some come from ahead and some come from behind but ive bought a big bat im all ready you see now my troubles are going to have troubles with me <eos>
<bos> i have learned now that while those who speak about ones miseries usually hurt those who keep silence hurt more <eos>
<bos> i have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night <eos>
<bos> i have never let my schooling interfere with my education <eos>
<bos> i have never listened to anyone who criticized my taste in space travel sideshows or gorillas when this occurs i pack up my dinosaurs and leave the room <eos>
<bos> i have never met a man so ignorant that i couldnt learn something from him <eos>
<bos> i have no special talents i am only passionately curious <eos>
<bos> i have not failed ive just found 10000 ways that wont work <eos>
<bos> i have nothing to declare except my genius <eos>
<bos> i have something i need to tell you he says i run my fingers along the tendons in his hands and look back at him i might be in love with you he smiles a little im waiting until im sure to tell you though <eos>
<bos> i have spread my dreams under your feet <eos>
<bos> i have the choice of being constantly active and happy or introspectively passive and sad or i can go mad by ricocheting in between <eos>
<bos> i have the simplest tastes i am always satisfied with the best <eos>
<bos> i havent been everywhere but its on my list <eos>
<bos> i hope shell be a fool thats the best thing a girl can be in this world a beautiful little fool <eos>
<bos> i hope that in this year to come you make mistakes <eos>
<bos> i hope that in this year to come you make mistakes because if you are making mistakesyoure doing something <eos>
<bos> i hope that one day you will have the experience of doing something you do not understand for someone you love <eos>
<bos> i hope you will have a wonderful year that youll dream dangerously and outrageously that youll make something that didnt exist before you made it that you will be loved and that you will be liked and that you will have people to love and to like in return and most importantly because i think there should be more kindness and more wisdom in the world right now that you will when you need to be be wise and that you will always be kind <eos>
<bos> i hope youre pleased with yourselves we could all have been killed or worse expelled now if you dont mind im going to bed <eos>
<bos> i just did some calculations and ive been able to determine that youre full of shit <eos>
<bos> i just want to be wonderful <eos>
<bos> i kept always two books in my pocket one to read one to write in <eos>
<bos> i knew in the silence that followed that anything could happen here it might be too late again i might have missed my chance but i would at least know i tried that i took my heart and extended my hand whatever the outcome <eos>
<bos> i knew the second i met yo <eos>
<bos> i knew when i met you an adventure was going to happen <eos>
<bos> i know how devastated you must be to miss me but leave a message and ill try to ease your agony <eos>
<bos> i know i am but summer to your heart and not the full four seasons of the year <eos>
<bos> i know its wrong god its all kinds of wrong but i just want to lie down with you and wake up with you just once just once ever in my life <eos>
<bos> i know not all that may be coming but be it what it will ill go to it laughing <eos>
<bos> i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought but world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones <eos>
<bos> i know of a cure for everything salt waterin one way or the other sweat or tears or the salt sea <eos>
<bos> i know some who are constantly drunk on books as other men are drunk on whiskey <eos>
<bos> i know were fucked up alright im impulsive and hot tempered and you get under my skin like no one else you act like you hate me one minute and then need me the next i never get anything right and i dont deserve youbut i fucking love you abby i love you more than i loved anyone or anything ever when youre around i dont need booze or money or the fighting or the onenight stands <eos>
<bos> i learned that courage was not the absence of fear but the triumph over it the brave man is not he who does not feel afraid but he who conquers that fear <eos>
<bos> i learned this at least by my experiment that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours <eos>
<bos> i lie to myself all the time but i never believe me <eos>
<bos> i like flaws i think they make things interesting <eos>
<bos> i like it when somebody gets excited about something its nice <eos>
<bos> i like living i have sometimes been wildly despairingly acutely miserable racked with sorrow but through it all i still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing <eos>
<bos> i like nonsense it wakes up the brain cells fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living <eos>
<bos> i like people too much or not at all ive got to go down deep to fall into people to really know them <eos>
<bos> i like the night without the dark wed never see the stars <eos>
<bos> i like to see people reunited i like to see people run to each other i like the kissing and the crying i like the impatience the stories that the mouth cant tell fast enough the ears that arent big enough the eyes that cant take in all of the change i like the hugging the bringing together the end of missing someone <eos>
<bos> i like too many things and get all confused and hungup running from one falling star to another till i drop this is the night what it does to you i had nothing to offer anybody except my own confusion <eos>
<bos> i like work it fascinates me i can sit and look at it for hours <eos>
<bos> i like your christ i do not like your christians your christians are so unlike your christ <eos>
<bos> i live for coincidences they briefly give to me the illusion or the hope that theres a pattern to my life and if theres a pattern then maybe im moving toward some kind of destiny where its all explained <eos>
<bos> i lived in books more than i lived anywhere else <eos>
<bos> i love books by the way way more than movies movies tell you what to think a good book lets you choose a few thoughts for yourself movies show you the pink house a good book tells you theres a pink house and lets you paint some of the finishing touches maybe choose the roof stylepark your own car out front my imagination has always topped anything a movie could come up with case in point those darned harry potter movies that was so not what that partveelachick fleur delacour looked like <eos>
<bos> i love deadlines i love the whooshing noise they make as they go by <eos>
<bos> i love mankind its people i cant stand <eos>
<bos> i love people who make me laugh i honestly think its the thing i like most to laugh it cures a multitude of ills its probably the most important thing in a person <eos>
<bos> i love sleep my life has the tendency to fall apart when im awake you know <eos>
<bos> i love to see a young girl go out and grab the world by the lapels lifes a bitch youve got to go out and kick ass <eos>
<bos> i love you also means i love you more than anyone loves you or has loved you or will love you and also i love you in a way that no one loves you or has loved you or will love you and also i love you in a way that i love no one else and never have loved anyone else and never will love anyone else <eos>
<bos> i love you as certain dark things are to be loved <eos>
<bos> i love you i am who i am because of you you are every reason every hope and every dream ive ever had and no matter what happens to us in the future everyday we are together is the greatest day of my life i will always be yours <eos>
<bos> i love you like a fat kid loves cake <eos>
<bos> i love you more than there are stars in the sky and fish in the sea <eos>
<bos> i love you remember they cannot take it <eos>
<bos> i love you without knowing how or when or from where i love you simply without problems or pride i love you in this way because i do not know any other way of loving but this in which there is no i or you so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand so intimate that when i fall asleep your eyes close <eos>
<bos> i loved her against reason against promise against peace against hope against happiness against all discouragement that could be <eos>
<bos> i loved you like a man loves a woman he never touches only writes to keeps little photographs of <eos>
<bos> i may die young but at least ill die smart <eos>
<bos> i may not have been sure about what really did interest me but i was absolutely sure about what didnt <eos>
<bos> i may not have gone where i intended to go but i think i have ended up where i needed to be <eos>
<bos> i mean if the relationship cant survive the long term why on earth would it be worth my time and energy for the short term <eos>
<bos> i meant said ipslore bitterly what is there in this world that truly makes living worthwhile <eos>
<bos> i meant what i said and i said what i meant an elephants faithful onehundred percent <eos>
<bos> i might be in love with you he smiles a little im waiting until im sure to tell you though <eos>
<bos> i must be a mermaid rango i have no fear of depths and a great fear of shallow living <eos>
<bos> i must have loved you a lot <eos>
<bos> i must learn to be content with being happier than i deserve <eos>
<bos> i must not fear fear is the mindkiller fear is the littledeath that brings total obliteration i will face my fear i will permit it to pass over me and through me and when it has gone past i will turn the inner eye to see its path where the fear has gone there will be nothing only i will remain <eos>
<bos> i myself am made entirely of flaws stitched together with good intentions <eos>
<bos> i myself have never been able to find out precisely what feminism is i only know that people call me a feminist whenever i express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat <eos>
<bos> i never change i simply become more myself <eos>
<bos> i never forget a face but in your case ill be glad to make an exception <eos>
<bos> i never travel without my diary one should always have something sensational to read in the train <eos>
<bos> i no longer believed in the idea of soul mates or love at first sight but i was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life if you were lucky you might meet someone who was exactly right for you not because he was perfect or because you were but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together <eos>
<bos> i nodded looking at rachel with respect you hit the lord of the titans in the eye with a blue plastic hairbrush <eos>
<bos> i pray because i cant help myself i pray because im helpless i pray because the need flows out of me all the time waking and sleeping it doesnt change god it changes me <eos>
<bos> i read a book one day and my whole life was changed <eos>
<bos> i read once that the ancient egyptians had fifty words for sand the eskimos had a hundred words for snow i wish i had a thousand words for love but all that comes to mind is the way you move against me while you sleep there are no words for that <eos>
<bos> i read so i can live more than one life in more than one place <eos>
<bos> i realize now that dying is easy living is hard <eos>
<bos> i realize only one person will be damaged beyond repair if peeta dies me <eos>
<bos> i refuse to answer that question on the grounds that i dont know the answer <eos>
<bos> i regret that it takes a life to learn how to live <eos>
<bos> i restore myself when im alone <eos>
<bos> i saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story from the tip of every branch like a fat purple fig a wonderful future beckoned and winked one fig was a husband and a happy home and children and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor and another fig was ee gee the amazing editor and another fig was europe and africa and south america and another fig was constantin and socrates and attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions and another fig was an olympic lady crew champion and beyond and above these figs were many more figs i couldnt quite make out i saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree starving to death just because i couldnt make up my mind which of the figs i would choose i wanted each and every one of them but choosing one meant losing all the rest and as i sat there unable to decide the figs began to wrinkle and go black and one by one they plopped to the ground at my feet <eos>
<bos> i say let the world go to hell but i should always have my tea <eos>
<bos> i shut my eyes and all the world drops dead <eos>
<bos> i sit beside the fire and thin <eos>
<bos> i solemnly swear that i am up to no good <eos>
<bos> i sought to hear the voice of god and climbed the topmost steeple but god declared go down again i dwell among the people <eos>
<bos> i speak to everyone in the same way whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university <eos>
<bos> i spent my life folded between the pages of books <eos>
<bos> i stood still vision blurring and in that moment i heard my heart break it was a small clean sound like the snapping of a flowers stem <eos>
<bos> i suffer from girlnextdooritis where the guy is friends with you and thats it <eos>
<bos> i suppose a fire that burns that bright is not meant to last <eos>
<bos> i suppose ill have to add the force of gravity to my list of enemies <eos>
<bos> i suspect the most we can hope for and its no small hope is that we never give up that we never stop giving ourselves permission to try to love and receive love <eos>
<bos> i suspect the truth is that we are waiting all of us against insurmountable odds for something extraordinary to happen to us <eos>
<bos> i think god in creating man somewhat overestimated his ability <eos>
<bos> i think if it is true tha <eos>
<bos> i think if ive learned anything about friendship its to hang in stay connected fight for them and let them fight for you dont walk away dont be distracted dont be too busy or tired dont take them for granted friends are part of the glue that holds life and faith together powerful stuff <eos>
<bos> i think that if i ever have kids and they are upset i wont tell them that people are starving in china or anything like that because it wouldnt change the fact that they were upset and even if somebody else has it much worse that doesnt really change the fact that you have what you have <eos>
<bos> i think that were all mentally ill those of us outside the asylums only hide it a little better and maybe not all that much better after all <eos>
<bos> i think the reward for conformity is that everyone likes you except yourself <eos>
<bos> i think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives <eos>
<bos> i think therefore i am <eos>
<bos> i think theres just one kind of folks folks <eos>
<bos> i think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us if the book were reading doesnt wake us up with a blow to the head what are we reading for so that it will make us happy as you write good lord we would be happy precisely if we had no books and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to but we need books that affect us like a disaster that grieve us deeply like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves like being banished into forests far from everyone like a suicide a book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us that is my belief <eos>
<bos> i think you should be a child for as long as you can i have been successful for 74 years being able to do that <eos>
<bos> i thought id lie on the floor and writhe in pain for a while he grunted it relaxes me <eos>
<bos> i took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart i am i am i am <eos>
<bos> i travel not to go anywhere but to go i travel for travels sake the great affair is to move <eos>
<bos> i used to believe in forever but forevers too good to be true <eos>
<bos> i used to dream about escaping my ordinary life but my life was never ordinary i had simply failed to notice how extraordinary it was <eos>
<bos> i walk around the school hallways and look at the people i look at the teachers and wonder why theyre here if they like their jobs or us and i wonder how smart they were when they were fifteen not in a mean way in a curious way its like looking at all the students and wondering whos had their heart broken that day and how they are able to cope with having three quizzes and a book report due on top of that or wondering who did the heart breaking and wondering why <eos>

<bos> i want everyone to meet you youre my favorite person of all time <eos>

<bos> i want to see you <eos>
<bos> i want to stand as close to the edge as i can without going over out on the edge you see all kinds of things you cant see from the center <eos>

<bos> i wanted the whole world or nothing <eos>
<bos> i wanted to tell the book thief many things about beauty and brutality but what could i tell her about those things that she didnt already know i wanted to explain that i am constantly overestimating and underestimating the human racethat rarely do i ever simply estimate it i wanted to ask her how the same thing could be so ugly and so glorious and its words and stories so damning and brilliant <eos>

<bos> i was always hungry for love just once i wanted to know what it was like to get my fill of it to be fed so much love i couldnt take any more just once <eos>
<bos> i was born with an enormous need for affection and a terrible need to give it <eos>
<bos> i was dead until you found me though i breathed i was sightless though i could see and then you cameand i was awakened <eos>

<bos> i will love you always when this red hair is white i will still love you when the smooth softness of youth is replaced by the delicate softness of age i will still want to touch your skin when your face is full of the lines of every smile you have ever smiled of every surprise i have seen flash through your eyes when every tear you have ever cried has left its mark upon your facei will treasure you all the more because i was there to see it all i will share your life with you meredith and i will love you until the last breath leaves your body or mine <eos>
<bos> i will not let anyone walk through my mind with their dirty feet <eos>
<bos> i will not say do not weep for not all tears are an evil <eos>
<bos> i will remember the kisse <eos>
<bos> i will take the sun in my mout <eos>
<bos> i wish i could freeze this moment right here right now and live in it forever <eos>

<bos> it isnt what we say or think that defines us but what we do <eos>
<bos> it isnt what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy it is what you think about it <eos>

<bos> it was love at first sight at last sight at ever and ever sight <eos>
<bos> it was not the feeling of completeness i so needed but the feeling of not being empty <eos>
<bos> it would seem that our lord finds our desires not too strong but too weak we are halfhearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea we are far too easily pleased <eos>

<bos> its all right to love someone who doesnt love you back as long as theyre worth you loving them as long as they deserve it <eos>
<bos> its amazing how a little tomorrow can make up for a whole lot of yesterday <eos>
<bos> its been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your mind firmly that you will <eos>
<bos> its discouraging to think how many people are shocked by honesty and how few by deceit <eos>

<bos> its funny how humans can wrap their mind around things and fit them into their version of reality <eos>

<bos> its just that most really goodlooking people are stupid so i exceed expectations <eos>
<bos> its just thati just think that some things are meant to be broken imperfect chaotic its the universes way of providing contrast you know there have to be a few holes in the road its how life is <eos>
<bos> its kind of fun to do the impossible <eos>
<bos> its like everyone tells a story about themselves inside their own head always all the time that story makes you what you are we build ourselves out of that story <eos>
<bos> its like learning to ride a unicorn you never forget <eos>
<bos> its like tolstoy said happiness is an allegory unhappiness <eos>
<bos> its much easier to not know things sometimes things change and friends leave and life doesnt stop for anybody i wanted to laugh or maybe get mad or maybe shrug at how strange everybody was especially me i think the idea is that every person has to live for his or her own life and than make the choice to share it with other people you cant just sit their and put everybodys lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love you just cant you have to do things im going to do what i want to do im going to be who i really am and im going to figure out what that is and we could all sit around and wonder and feel bad about each other and blame a lot of people for what they did or didnt do or what they didnt know i dont know i guess there could always be someone to blame its just different maybe its good to put things in perspective but sometimes i think that the only perspective is to really be there because its okay to feel things i was really there and that was enough to make me feel infinite i feel infinite <eos>
<bos> its no good pretending that any relationship has a future if your record collections disagree violently or if your favorite films wouldnt even speak to each other if they met at a party <eos>
<bos> its not always necessary to be strong but to feel strong <eos>
<bos> its not because i want to make out with her <eos>
<bos> its not denial im just selective about the reality i accept <eos>
<bos> its not gray clary felt compelled to point out its green <eos>
<bos> its not the face but the expressions on it its not the voice but what you say its not how you look in that body but the thing you do with it you are beautiful <eos>
<bos> its not the load that breaks you down its the way you carry it <eos>
<bos> its not the size of the dog in the fight its the size of the fight in the dog <eos>
<bos> its not true that i had nothing on i had the radio on <eos>
<bos> its not worth doing something unless someone somewhere would much rather you werent doing it <eos>
<bos> its often just enough to be with someone i dont need to touch them not even talk a feeling passes between you both youre not alone <eos>
<bos> its only after weve lost everything that were free to do anything <eos>
<bos> its only those who do nothing that make no mistakes i suppose <eos>
<bos> its possible to go on no matter how impossible it seems and that in time the grief lessens it may not go away completely but after a while its not so overwhelming <eos>
<bos> its really a wonder that i havent dropped all my ideals because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out yet i keep them because in spite of everything i still believe that people are really good at heart <eos>
<bos> its so hard to forget pain but its even harder to remember sweetness we have no scar to show for happiness we learn so little from peace <eos>
<bos> its so much darker when a light goes out than it would have been if it had never shone <eos>
<bos> its so strange how life works you want something and you wait and wait and feel like its taking forever to come then it happens and its over and all you want to do is curl back up in that moment before things changed <eos>
<bos> its strange because sometimes i read a book and i think i am the people in the book <eos>
<bos> its the friends you can call up at 4 am that matter <eos>
<bos> its the job thats never started as takes longest to finish <eos>
<bos> its the mortal cup jace not the mortal toilet bowl <eos>

<bos> its the questions we cant answer that teach us the most they teach us how to think if you give a man an answer all he gains is a little fact but give him a question and hell look for his own answers <eos>
<bos> ive been homesick for countries ive never been and longed to be where i couldnt be <eos>
<bos> ive been making a list of the things they dont teach you at school they dont teach you how to love somebody they dont teach you how to be famous they dont teach you how to be rich or how to be poor they dont teach you how to walk away from someone you dont love any longer they dont teach you how to know whats going on in someone elses mind they dont teach you what to say to someone whos dying they dont teach you anything worth knowing <eos>
<bos> ive begun to realize that you can listen to silence and learn from it it has a quality and a dimension all its own <eos>
<bos> ive found that there is always some beauty left in nature sunshine freedom in yourself these can all help you <eos>
<bos> ive got a stele we can use who wants to do me <eos>
<bos> ive got nothing to do today but smile <eos>
<bos> ive got the guts to die what i want to know is have you got the guts to live <eos>
<bos> ive learned that people will forget what you said people will forget what you did but people will never forget how you made them feel <eos>
<bos> ive lived through some terrible things in my life some of which actually happened <eos>
<bos> ive never been lonely ive been in a room ive felt suicidal ive been depressed ive felt awful awful beyond all but i never felt that one other person could enter that room and cure what was bothering meor that any number of people could enter that room in other words loneliness is something ive never been bothered with because ive always had this terrible itch for solitude its being at a party or at a stadium full of people cheering for something that i might feel loneliness ill quote ibsen the strongest men are the most alone ive never thought well some beautiful blonde will come in here and give me a fuckjob rub my balls and ill feel good no that wont help you know the typical crowd wow its friday night what are you going to do just sit there well yeah because theres nothing out there its stupidity stupid people mingling with stupid people let them stupidify themselves ive never been bothered with the need to rush out into the night i hid in bars because i didnt want to hide in factories thats all sorry for all the millions but ive never been lonely i like myself im the best form of entertainment i have lets drink more wine <eos>

<bos> jace shook his blond head in exasperation <eos>
<bos> jane be still dont struggle so like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation <eos>
<bos> jesus luke exclaimed <eos>
<bos> judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers <eos>
<bos> just because you call an electric eel a rubber duck doesnt make it a rubber duck does it and god help the poor bastard who decides they want to take a bath with the duckie jace wayland <eos>
<bos> just because you have the emotional range of a teaspoon doesnt mean we all have <eos>
<bos> just because youre paranoid doesnt mean they arent after you <eos>
<bos> just tell me how to be different in a way that makes sense <eos>
<bos> just when you think it cant get any worse it can and just when you think it cant get any better it can <eos>

<bos> keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions small people always do that but the really great make you feel that you too can become great <eos>
<bos> keep in mind that people change but the past doesnt <eos>
<bos> keep smiling because life is a beautiful thing and theres so much to smile about <eos>
<bos> keep your face always toward the sunshine and shadows will fall behind you <eos>
<bos> kind words can be short and easy to speak but their echoes are truly endless <eos>
<bos> kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see <eos>
<bos> kindred spirits are not so scarce as i used to think its splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world <eos>
<bos> kiss me and you will see how important i am <eos>
<bos> knock and hell open the doo <eos>
<bos> knowing others is intelligence <eos>
<bos> knowing too much of your future is never a good thing <eos>
<bos> knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom <eos>
<bos> knowledge speaks but wisdom listens <eos>
<bos> lack of direction not lack of time is the problem we all have twentyfour hour days <eos>
<bos> laters baby <eos>
<bos> laugh and the world laughs with you snore and you sleep alone <eos>
<bos> laugh even when you feel too sick or too worn out or tired <eos>
<bos> laughter is timeless imagination has no age and dreams are forever <eos>
<bos> laughter is wine for the soul laughter soft or loud and deep tinged through with seriousness the hilarious declaration made by man that life is worth living <eos>
<bos> learn from the mistakes of others you can never live long enough to make them all yourself <eos>
<bos> learn the rules break the rules make up new rules break the new rules <eos>
<bos> learn to value yourself which means fight for your happiness <eos>
<bos> learn what is to be taken seriously and laugh at the rest <eos>
<bos> learning to ignore things is one of the great paths to inner peace <eos>
<bos> let everything happen to yo <eos>
<bos> let me give you a piece of advice the handsome young fellow whos trying to rescue you from a hideous fate is never wrong not even if he says the sky is purple and made of hedgehogs <eos>
<bos> let me live love and say it well in good sentences <eos>
<bos> let me tell you this if you meet a loner no matter what they tell you its not because they enjoy solitude its because they have tried to blend into the world before and people continue to disappoint them <eos>
<bos> let no man pull you so low as to hate him <eos>
<bos> let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier be the living expression of gods kindness kindness in your face kindness in your eyes kindness in your smile <eos>
<bos> let our scars fall in love <eos>
<bos> let the first act of every morning be to make the following resolve for the day <eos>
<bos> let the rain kiss you let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops let the rain sing you a lullaby <eos>
<bos> let there be spaces in your togetherness and let the winds of the heavens dance between you love one another but make not a bond of love let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls fill each others cup but drink not from one cup give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf sing and dance together and be joyous but let each one of you be alone even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music give your hearts but not into each others keeping for only the hand of life can contain your hearts and stand together yet not too near together for the pillars of the temple stand apart and the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each others shadow <eos>
<bos> let us be grateful to the people who make us happy they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom <eos>
<bos> let us find the dam snack bar zoe said we should eat while we can <eos>
<bos> let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead <eos>
<bos> let us read and let us dance these two amusements will never do any harm to the world <eos>
<bos> let us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress adventure <eos>
<bos> lets think the unthinkable lets do the undoable let us prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself and see if we may not eff it after all <eos>
<bos> letting go doesnt mean that you dont care about someone anymore its just realizing that the only person you really have control over is yourself <eos>
<bos> letting go means to come to the realization that some people are a part of your history but not a part of your destiny <eos>
<bos> life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs <eos>
<bos> life becomes easier and more beautiful when we can see the good in other people <eos>
<bos> life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards <eos>
<bos> life doesnt imitate art it imitates bad television <eos>
<bos> life has no meaning each of us has meaning and we bring it to life it is a waste to be asking the question when you are the answer <eos>
<bos> life he realize was much like a song in the beginning there is mystery in the end there is confirmation but its in the middle where all the emotion resides to make the whole thing worthwhile <eos>
<bos> life is a beautiful magnificent thing even to a jellyfish <eos>
<bos> life is a book and there are a thousand pages i have not yet read <eos>
<bos> life is a disease sexually transmitted and invariably fatal <eos>
<bos> life is a mirror if you frown at it it frowns back if you smile it returns the greeting <eos>
<bos> life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes dont resist them that only creates sorrow let reality be reality let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like <eos>
<bos> life is an awful ugly place to not have a best friend <eos>
<bos> life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all <eos>
<bos> life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about <eos>
<bos> life is for the living <eos>
<bos> life is like a prism what you see depends on how you turn the glass <eos>
<bos> life is like riding a bicycle to keep your balance you must keep moving <eos>
<bos> life is not a matter of holding good cards but of playing a poor hand well <eos>
<bos> life is pain highness anyone who says differently is selling something <eos>
<bos> life is to be enjoyed not endured <eos>
<bos> life is too short to waste any amount of time on wondering what other people think about you in the first place if they had better things going on in their lives they wouldnt have the time to sit around and talk about you whats important to me is not others opinions of me but whats important to me is my opinion of myself <eos>
<bos> life is what happens to us while we are making other plans <eos>
<bos> life isnt about finding yourself life is about creating yourself <eos>
<bos> life isnt finding shelter in the storm its about learning to dance in the rain <eos>
<bos> life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride <eos>
<bos> life shrinks or expands in proportion to ones courage <eos>
<bos> life will break you nobody can protect you from that and living alone wont either for solitude will also break you with its yearning you have to love you have to feel it is the reason you are here on earth you are here to risk your heart you are here to be swallowed up and when it happens that you are broken or betrayed or left or hurt or death brushes near let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps wasting their sweetness tell yourself you tasted as many as you could <eos>
<bos> lifes under no obligation to give us what we expect <eos>
<bos> light thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong no matter how fast light travels it finds the darkness has always got there first and is waiting for it <eos>
<bos> like all magnificent things its very simple <eos>
<bos> like most misery it started with apparent happiness <eos>
<bos> listen to the mustnts child listen to the donts listen to the shouldnts the impossibles the wonts listen to the never haves then listen close to me anything can happen child anything can be <eos>
<bos> literature is a luxury fiction is a necessity <eos>
<bos> literature is a textually transmitted disease normally contracted in childhood <eos>
<bos> literature is the most agreeable way of ignoring life <eos>
<bos> live as if you were to die tomorrow learn as if you were to live forever <eos>
<bos> live in the present remember the past and fear not the future for it doesnt exist and never shall there is only now <eos>
<bos> live in the sunshine swim the sea drink the wild air <eos>
<bos> live the life of your dreams be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others <eos>
<bos> live to the point of tears <eos>
<bos> live travel adventure bless and dont be sorry <eos>

<bos> lock up your libraries if you like but there is no gate no lock no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind <eos>
<bos> logic will get you from a to z imagination will get you everywhere <eos>
<bos> lolita light of my life fire of my loins my sin my soul loleeta the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap at three on the teeth lo lee ta she was lo plain lo in the morning standing four feet ten in one sock she was lola in slacks she was dolly at school she was dolores on the dotted line but in my arms she was always lolita did she have a precursor she did indeed she did in point of fact there might have been no lolita at all had i not loved one summer an initial girlchild in a princedom by the sea oh when about as many years before lolita was born as my age was that summer you can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style ladies and gentlemen of the jury exhibit number one is what the seraphs the misinformed simple noblewinged seraphs envied look at this tangle of thorns <eos>
<bos> loneliness is the human condition cultivate it the way it tunnels into you allows your soul room to grow never expect to outgrow loneliness never hope to find people who will understand you someone to fill that space an intelligent sensitive person is the exception the very great exception if you expect to find people who will understand you you will grow murderous with disappointment the best youll ever do is to understand yourself know what it is that you want and not let the cattle stand in your way <eos>
<bos> look after my heart ive left it with you <eos>
<bos> look again at that dot thats here thats home thats us on it everyone you love everyone you know everyone you ever heard of every human being who ever was lived out their lives the aggregate of our joy and suffering thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines every hunter and forager every hero and coward every creator and destroyer of civilization every king and peasant every young couple in love every mother and father hopeful child inventor and explorer every teacher of morals every corrupt politician every superstar every supreme leader every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived thereon a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam <eos>
<bos> look at everything always as though you were seeing it either for the first or last time thus is your time on earth filled with glory <eos>
<bos> lord what fools these mortals be <eos>
<bos> lost love is still love it takes a different form thats all you cant see their smile or bring them food or tousle their hair or move them around a dance floor but when those senses weaken another heightens memory memory becomes your partner you nurture it you hold it you dance with it <eos>
<bos> lost opportunities lost possibilities feelings we can never get back thats part of what it means to be alive but inside our heads at least thats where i imagine it theres a little room where we store those memories a room like the stacks in this library and to understand the workings of our own heart we have to keep on making new reference cards we have to dust things off every once in awhile let in fresh air change the water in the flower vases in other words youll live forever in your own private library <eos>
<bos> love all trust a few do wrong to none <eos>
<bos> love can change a person the way a parent can change a baby awkwardly and often with a great deal of mess <eos>
<bos> love conquers all aphrodite promised look at helen and paris did they let anything come between them <eos>
<bos> love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does love is a battle love is a war love is a growing up <eos>
<bos> love does not consist of gazing at each other but in looking outward together in the same direction <eos>
<bos> love doesnt just sit there like a stone it has to be made like bread remade all the time made new <eos>
<bos> love is a fire but whether it is going to warm your hearth or burn down your house you can never tell <eos>
<bos> love is a temporary madness it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides and when it subsides you have to make a decision you have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part because this is what love is love is not breathlessness it is not excitement it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body no dont blush i am telling you some truths that is just being in love which any fool can do love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away and this is both an art and a fortunate accident <eos>
<bos> love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired <eos>
<bos> love is an untamed force when we try to control it it destroys us when we try to imprison it it enslaves us when we try to understand it it leaves us feeling lost and confused <eos>
<bos> love is like a tree it grows by itself roots itself deeply in our being and continues to flourish over a heart in ruin the inexplicable fact is that the blinder it is the more tenacious it is it is never stronger than when it is completely unreasonable <eos>
<bos> love is like the wind you cant see it but you can feel it <eos>
<bos> love is needing someone love is putting up with someones bad qualities because they somehow complete you <eos>
<bos> love is not affectionate feeling but a steady wish for the loved persons ultimate good as far as it can be obtained <eos>
<bos> love is patient love is kind it does not envy it does not boast it is not proud it is not rude it is not selfseeking it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth it always protects always trusts always hopes always perseveres <eos>
<bos> love is so short forgetting is so long <eos>
<bos> love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own <eos>
<bos> love is the absence of judgment <eos>
<bos> love it will kill you and save you both <eos>
<bos> love looks not with the eyes but with the mind <eos>
<bos> love makes your soul crawl out from its hiding place <eos>
<bos> love never dies a natural death it dies because we dont know how to replenish its source it dies of blindness and errors and betrayals it dies of illness and wounds it dies of weariness of witherings of tarnishings <eos>
<bos> love the life you live <eos>
<bos> love the world and yourself in it move through it as though it offers no resistance as though the world is your natural element <eos>
<bos> lovers dont finally meet somewhere theyre in each other all along <eos>
<bos> loyalty to country always loyalty to government when it deserves it <eos>
<bos> luxury is not a necessity to me but beautiful and good things are <eos>
<bos> mad girls love son <eos>
<bos> magnus standing by the door snapped his fingers impatiently move it along teenagers the only person who gets to canoodle in my bedroom is my magnificent self <eos>
<bos> make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may previously never have thought of doing or been too hesitant to attempt so many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security conformity and conservation all of which may appear to give one peace of mind but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future the very basic core of a mans living spirit is his passion for adventure the joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon for each day to have a new and different sun if you want to get more out of life you must lose your inclination for monotonous security and adopt a helterskelter style of life that will at first appear to you to be crazy but once you become accustomed to such a life you will see its full meaning and its incredible beauty <eos>

<bos> she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it <eos>
<bos> she had always wanted words she loved them grew up on them words gave her clarity brought reason shape <eos>

<bos> she was ready to deny the existence of space and time rather than admit that love might not be eternal <eos>
<bos> she was the heir of ash and fire and she would bow to no one <eos>
<bos> she wasnt bitter she was sad though but it was a hopeful kind of sad the kind of sad that just takes time <eos>

<bos> we have to allow ourselves to be loved by the people who really love us the people who really matter too much of the time we are blinded by our own pursuits of people to love us people that dont even matter while all that time we waste and the people who do love us have to stand on the sidewalk and watch us beg in the streets its time to put an end to this its time for us to let ourselves be loved <eos>

<bos> we have to dare to be ourselves however frightening or strange that self may prove to be <eos>

<bos> we live for books <eos>
<bos> we love the things we love for what they are <eos>
<bos> we loved with a love that was more than love <eos>
<bos> we must be willing to let go of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us <eos>
<bos> we need in love to practice only this letting each other go for holding on comes easily we do not need to learn it <eos>
<bos> we need not to be let alone we need to be really bothered once in a while how long is it since you were really bothered about something important about something real <eos>
<bos> we need to talk all of us about what were going to do now <eos>
<bos> we read to know were not alone <eos>
<bos> we should all start to live before we get too old fear is stupid so are regrets <eos>
<bos> we should consider every day lost on which we have not danced at least once <eos>
<bos> we shouldnt be looking for heroes we should be looking for good ideas <eos>
<bos> we sit silently and watch the world around us this has taken a lifetime to learn it seems only the old are able to sit next to one another and not say anything and still feel content the young brash and impatient must always break the silence it is a waste for silence is pure silence is holy it draws people together because only those who are comfortable with each other can sit without speaking this is the great paradox <eos>
<bos> we take for granted the very things that most deserve our gratitude <eos>
<bos> we waste time looking for the perfect lover instead of creating the perfect love <eos>
<bos> we write to taste life twice in the moment and in retrospect <eos>

<bos> well it seems to me that the best relationships the ones that last are frequently the ones that are rooted in friendship you know one day you look at the person and you see something more than you did the night before like a switch has been flicked somewhere and the person who was just a friend is suddenly the only person you can ever imagine yourself with <eos>

<bos> were all going to die all of us what a circus that alone should make us love each other but it doesnt we are terrorized and flattened by trivialities we are eaten up by nothing <eos>
<bos> were all human arent we every human life is worth the same and worth saving <eos>
<bos> were staying together he promised youre not getting away from me never again <eos>
<bos> weve got to live no matter how many skies have fallen <eos>
<bos> what a blessing it is to love books as i love them to be able to converse with the dead and to live amidst the unreal <eos>
<bos> what a slut time is she screws everybody <eos>
<bos> what a treacherous thing to believe that a person is more than a person <eos>

<bos> what is right is not always popular and what is popular is not always right <eos>

<bos> what is that you express in your eyes it seems to me more than all the print i have read in my life <eos>
<bos> what is the point of being alive if you dont at least try to do something remarkable <eos>
<bos> what lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us <eos>

<bos> what matters most is how well you walk through the fire <eos>

<bos> what you do makes a difference and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make <eos>
<bos> what you do speaks so loudly that i cannot hear what you say <eos>

<bos> what you seek is seeking you <eos>
<bos> what youre supposed to do when you dont like a thing is change it if you cant change it change the way you think about it dont complain <eos>
<bos> whatever it is youre seeking wont come in the form youre expecting <eos>

<bos> whatever you can do or dream you can begin it <eos>
<bos> whatever you do you need courage whatever course you decide upon there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong there are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe your critics are right to map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs peace has its victories but it takes brave men and women to win them <eos>
<bos> whatever youre meant to do do it now the conditions are always impossible <eos>

<bos> when adults say teenagers think they are invincible with that sly stupid smile on their faces they dont know how right they are we need never be hopeless because we can never be irreparably broken we think that we are invincible because we are we cannot be born and we cannot die like all energy we can only change shapes and sizes and manifestations they forget that when they get old they get scared of losing and failing but that part of us greater than the sum of our parts cannot begin and cannot end and so it cannot fail <eos>
<bos> when did we see each other facetoface not until you saw into my cracks and i saw into yours before that we were just looking at ideas of each other like looking at your window shade but never seeing inside but once the vessel cracks the light can get in the light can get out <eos>
<bos> when everything goes to hell the people who stand by you without flinching they are your family <eos>
<bos> when god created mothers <eos>

<bos> when his life was ruined his family killed his farm destroyed job knelt down on the ground and yelled up to the heavens why god why me and the thundering voice of god answered theres just something about you that pisses me off <eos>
<bos> when i am with you we stay up all night <eos>
<bos> when i despair i remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won there have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they can seem invincible but in the end they always fall think of italways <eos>
<bos> when i do good i feel good when i do bad i feel bad thats my religion <eos>
<bos> when i get lonely these days i think so be lonely liz learn your way around loneliness make a map of it sit with it for once in your life welcome to the human experience but never again use another persons body or emotions as a scratching post for your own unfulfilled yearnings <eos>
<bos> when i had nothing to lose i had everything when i stopped being who i am i found myself <eos>
<bos> when i have a little money i buy books and if i have any left i buy food and clothes <eos>
<bos> when i look at my life and its secret colours i feel like bursting into tears <eos>
<bos> when i look at my room i see a girl who loves books <eos>
<bos> when i saw you i fell in love and you smiled because you knew <eos>
<bos> when i say its you i like im talking about that part of you that knows that life is far more than anything you can ever see or hear or touch that deep part of you that allows you to stand for those things without which humankind cannot survive love that conquers hate peace that rises triumphant over war and justice that proves more powerful than greed <eos>

<bos> when i was a child adults would tell me not to make things up warning me of what would happen if i did as far as i can tell so far it seems to involve lots of foreign travel and not having to get up too early in the morning <eos>
<bos> when i was a little girl i used to read fairy tales in fairy tales you meet prince charming and hes everything you ever wanted in fairy tales the bad guy is very easy to spot the bad guy is always wearing a black cape so you always know who he is then you grow up and you realize that prince charming is not as easy to find as you thought you realize the bad guy is not wearing a black cape and hes not easy to spot hes really funny and he makes you laugh and he has perfect hair <eos>
<bos> when i was about eight i decided that the most wonderful thing next to a human being was a book <eos>
<bos> when i was your age television was called books <eos>
<bos> when im good im very good but when im bad im better <eos>
<bos> when it comes down to it i let them think what they want if they care enough to bother with what i do then im already better than them <eos>
<bos> when it is dark enough you can see the stars <eos>
<bos> when life gives you lemons squirt someone in the eye <eos>
<bos> when love is not madness it is not love <eos>
<bos> when one door of happiness closes another opens but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us <eos>
<bos> when one is in love one always begins by deceiving ones self and one always ends by deceiving others that is what the world calls a romance <eos>
<bos> when one tugs at a single thing in nature he finds it attached to the rest of the world <eos>
<bos> when people dont express themselves they die one piece at a time <eos>
<bos> when people talk listen completely most people never listen <eos>
<bos> when someone is crying of course the noble thing to do is to comfort them but if someone is trying to hide their tears it may also be noble to pretend you do not notice them <eos>
<bos> when someone is in your heart theyre never truly gone they can come back to you even at unlikely times <eos>
<bos> when someone leaves its because someone else is about to arrive <eos>
<bos> when someone loves you the way they talk about you is different you feel safe and comfortable <eos>
<bos> when someone shows you who they are believe them the first time <eos>
<bos> when the first baby laughed for the first time its laugh broke into a thousand pieces and they all went skipping about and that was the beginning of fairies <eos>
<bos> when the heart speaks the mind finds it indecent to object <eos>
<bos> when the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace <eos>
<bos> when the snows fall and the white winds blow the lone wolf dies but the pack survives <eos>
<bos> when things break its not the actual breaking that prevents them from getting back together again its because a little piece gets lost the two remaining ends couldnt fit together even if they wanted to the whole shape has changed <eos>
<bos> when we are no longer able to change a situation we are challenged to change ourselves <eos>
<bos> when we are tired we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago <eos>
<bos> when we are young the words are scattered all around us as they are assembled by experience so also are we sentence by sentence until the story takes shape <eos>
<bos> when we dont know who to hate we hate ourselves <eos>
<bos> when we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives mean the most to us we often find that it is those who instead of giving advice solutions or cures have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand the friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement who can tolerate not knowing not curing not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness that is a friend who cares <eos>
<bos> when we least expect it life sets us a challenge to test our courage and willingness to change at such a moment there is no point in pretending that nothing has happened or in saying that we are not yet ready the challenge will not wait life does not look back a week is more than enough time for us to decide whether or not to accept our destiny <eos>
<bos> when we love we always strive to become better than we are when we strive to become better than we are everything around us becomes better too <eos>
<bos> when were incomplete were always searching for somebody to complete us when after a few years or a few months of a relationship we find that were still unfulfilled we blame our partners and take up with somebody more promising this can go on and onseries polygamyuntil we admit that while a partner can add sweet dimensions to our lives we each of us are responsible for our own fulfillment nobody else can provide it for us and to believe otherwise is to delude ourselves dangerously and to program for eventual failure every relationship we enter <eos>
<bos> when will you learn that there isnt a word for everything <eos>
<bos> when you are content to be simply yourself and dont compare or compete everyone will respect you <eos>
<bos> when you are courting a nice girl an hour seems like a second when you sit on a redhot cinder a second seems like an hour thats relativity <eos>
<bos> when you do things from your soul you feel a river moving in you a joy <eos>
<bos> when you find your path you must not be afraid you need to have sufficient courage to make mistakes disappointment defeat and despair are the tools god uses to show us the way <eos>
<bos> when you go into the er one of the first things they ask you to do is rate your pain on a scale of one to ten and from there they decide which drugs to use and how quickly to use them id been asked this question hundreds of times over the years and i remember once early on when i couldnt get my breath and it felt like my chest was on fire flames licking the inside of my ribs fighting for a way to burn out of my body my parents took me to the er nurse asked me about the pain and i couldnt even speak so i held up nine fingers <eos>
<bos> when you have eliminated all which is impossible then whatever remains however improbable must be the truth <eos>
<bos> when you have lost hope you have lost everything and when you think all is lost when all is dire and bleak there is always hope <eos>
<bos> when you laugh laugh like hell and when you get angry get good and angry try to be alive you will be dead soon enough <eos>
<bos> when you play a game of thrones you win or you die <eos>
<bos> when you read a book you hold anothers mind in your hands <eos>
<bos> when you stop expecting people to be perfect you can like them for who they are <eos>
<bos> when you trip over love it is easy to get up but when you fall in love it is impossible to stand again <eos>
<bos> when youre in jail a good friend will be trying to bail you out a best friend will be in the cell next to you saying damn that was fun <eos>
<bos> when youre struggling with something look at all the people around you and realize that every single person you see is struggling with something and to them its just as hard as what youre going through <eos>
<bos> whenever i feel the need to exercise i lie down until it goes away <eos>
<bos> whenever my environment had failed to support or nourish me i had clutched at books <eos>
<bos> whenever people agree with me i always feel i must be wrong <eos>
<bos> whenever you feel like criticizing any onejust remember that all the people in this world havent had the advantages that youve had <eos>
<bos> whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority it is time to reform or pause and reflect <eos>
<bos> whenever you read a cancer booklet or website or whatever they always list depression among the side effects of cancer but in fact depression is not a side effect of cancer depression is a side effect of dying <eos>
<bos> whenever you think or you believe or you know youre a lot of other people but the moment you feel youre nobodybutyourself <eos>
<bos> where is human nature so weak as in the bookstore <eos>
<bos> where is wood said harry suddenly realizing he wasnt there <eos>
<bos> where there is love there is life <eos>
<bos> where there is love there is often also hate they can exist side by side <eos>
<bos> where words leave off music begins <eos>
<bos> where you used to be there is a hole in the world which i find myself constantly walking around in the daytime and falling in at night i miss you like hell <eos>
<bos> wheresoever you go go with all your heart <eos>
<bos> wherever you go becomes a part of you somehow <eos>
<bos> whether you think you can or you think you cantyoure right <eos>
<bos> while i sleep i dream of you and when i wake i long to hold you in my arms if anything our time apart has only made me more certain that i want to spend my nights by your side and my days with your heart <eos>
<bos> who are you to judge the life i live <eos>
<bos> who being loved is poor <eos>
<bos> who controls the past controls the future who controls the present controls the past <eos>
<bos> who in the world am i ah thats the great puzzle <eos>
<bos> who said nights were for sleep <eos>

<bos> why do people have to be this lonely whats the point of it all millions of people in this world all of them yearning looking to others to satisfy them yet isolating themselves why was the earth put here just to nourish human loneliness <eos>
<bos> why do people say grow some balls balls are weak and sensitive if you wanna be tough grow a vagina those things can take a pounding <eos>
<bos> why do you go away so that you can come back so that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors and the people there see you differently too coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving <eos>
<bos> why dont you like to be touched <eos>
<bos> why fit in when you were born to stand out <eos>
<bos> why is it he said one time at the subway entrance i feel ive known you so many years <eos>
<bos> why sometimes ive believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast <eos>

<bos> without suffering thered be no compassion <eos>
<bos> without you in my arms i feel an emptiness in my soul i find myself searching the crowds for your face i know its an impossibility but i cannot help myself <eos>
<bos> woke up this morning with a terrific urge to lie in bed all day and read <eos>
<bos> women and cats will do as they please and men and dogs should relax and get used to the idea <eos>

<bos> women want love to be a novel men a short story <eos>
<bos> women who seek to be equal with men lack ambition <eos>
<bos> words are easy like the wind faithful friends are hard to find <eos>
<bos> words are of course the most powerful drug used by mankind <eos>
<bos> words are pale shadows of forgotten names as names have power words have power words can light fires in the minds of men words can wring tears from the hardest hearts <eos>
<bos> words dazzle and deceive because they are mimed by the face but black words on a white page are the soul laid bare <eos>
<bos> words i think are such unpredictable creatures <eos>
<bos> words were different when they lived inside of you <eos>

<bos> yesterday i was clever so i wanted to change the world today i am wise so i am changing myself <eos>
<bos> yesterday is gone tomorrow has not yet come we have only today let us begin <eos>
<bos> yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery today is a gift of god which is why we call it the present <eos>
<bos> you alone are enough you have nothing to prove to anybody <eos>
<bos> you always have a choice its just that some people make the wrong one <eos>
<bos> you are and always have been my dream <eos>
<bos> you are imperfect permanently and inevitably flawed and you are beautiful <eos>
<bos> you are my best friend as well as my lover and i do not know which side of you i enjoy the most i treasure each side just as i have treasured our life together <eos>
<bos> you are not entitled to your opinion you are entitled to you <eos>
<bos> you are not special youre not a beautiful and unique snowflake youre the same decaying organic matter as everything else were all part of the same compost heap were all singing all dancing crap of the world <eos>
<bos> you are not your job youre not how much money you have in the bank you are not the car you drive youre not the contents of your wallet you are not your fucking khakis you are all singing all dancing crap of the world <eos>
<bos> you are okay he asked not eaten by monsters <eos>
<bos> you are so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are <eos>
<bos> you are the answer to every prayer ive offered you are a song a dream a whisper and i dont know how i could have lived without you for as long as i have <eos>
<bos> you believe in a book that has talking animals wizards witches demons sticks turning into snakes burning bushes food falling from the sky people walking on water and all sorts of magical absurd and primitive stories and you say that we are the ones that need help <eos>
<bos> you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself <eos>
<bos> you can cut all the flowers but you cannot keep spring from coming <eos>
<bos> you can hate a place with all your heart and soul and still be homesick for it <eos>
<bos> you can have it all just not all at once <eos>
<bos> you can love someone so muchbut you can never love people as much as you can miss them <eos>
<bos> you can make anything by writing <eos>
<bos> you can never be overdressed or overeducated <eos>
<bos> you can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me <eos>
<bos> you can only be young once but you can always be immature <eos>
<bos> you can spend minutes hours days weeks or even months overanalyzing a situation trying to put the pieces together justifying what couldve wouldve happened or you can just leave the pieces on the floor and move the fuck on <eos>
<bos> you can talk with someone for years everyday and still it wont mean as much as what you can have when you sit in front of someone not saying a word yet you feel that person with your heart you feel like you have known the person for forever connections are made with the heart not the tongue <eos>
<bos> you cannot find peace by avoiding life <eos>
<bos> you cannot pick and choose what parts of her to love <eos>
<bos> you cannot protect yourself from sadness without protecting yourself from happiness <eos>
<bos> you cannot swim for new horizons until you have courage to lose sight of the shore <eos>
<bos> you cant be happy unless youre unhappy sometimes <eos>
<bos> you cant depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus <eos>
<bos> you cant force love i realized its there or it isnt if its not there youve got to be able to admit it if it is there youve got to do whatever it takes to protect the ones you love <eos>
<bos> you cant lie to your soul <eos>
<bos> you cant live your life for other people youve got to do whats right for you even if it hurts some people you love <eos>
<bos> you cant measure the mutual affection of two human beings by the number of words they exchange <eos>
<bos> you cant stay in your corner of the forest waiting for others to come to you you have to go to them sometimes <eos>
<bos> you cant stop the futur <eos>
<bos> you cant wait for inspiration you have to go after it with a club <eos>
<bos> you care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it <eos>
<bos> you could have fooled me everytime i called you luke said you were sick i figured you were avoiding me again <eos>
<bos> you could have had anything else in the world and you asked for me <eos>
<bos> you could say sorry suggested harry bluntly <eos>
<bos> you couldnt relive your life skipping the awful parts without losing what made it worthwhile you had to accept it as a wholelike the world or the person you loved <eos>
<bos> you deal with mythological stuff for a few years you learn that paradises are usually places where you get killed <eos>
<bos> you do not have to be good <eos>
<bos> you do not write your life with wordsyou write it with actions what you think is not important it is only important what yo <eos>
<bos> you dont get to choose if you get hurt in this worldbut you do have some say in who hurts you i like my choices <eos>
<bos> you dont have to burn books to destroy a culture just get people to stop reading them <eos>
<bos> you dont love a girl because of beauty you love her because she sings a song only you can understand <eos>
<bos> you dont love someone because theyre perfect you love them in spite of the fact that theyre not <eos>
<bos> you dont love someone for their looks or their clothes or for their fancy car but because they sing a song only you can hear <eos>
<bos> you dont remember what happened what you remember becomes what happened <eos>
<bos> you educate a man you educate a man you educate a woman you educate a generation <eos>
<bos> you endure what is unbearable and you bear it that is all <eos>
<bos> you forget what you want to remember and you remember what you want to forget <eos>
<bos> you gain strength courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face you are able to say to yourself i have lived through this horror i can take the next thing that comes along you must do the thing you think you cannot do <eos>
<bos> you gave me a forever within the numbered days and im grateful <eos>
<bos> you get a little moody sometimes but i think thats because you like to read people that like to read are always a little fucked up <eos>
<bos> you get what anybody gets you get a lifetime <eos>
<bos> you guessed you must have been pretty sure considering you could have killed me <eos>
<bos> you have brains in your head you have feet in your shoes you can steer yourself any direction you choose youre on your own and you know what you know and you are the one wholl decide where to go <eos>
<bos> you have enemies good that means youve stood up for something sometime in your life <eos>
<bos> you have everything needed for the extravagant journey that is your life <eos>
<bos> you have power over your mind not outside events realize this and you will find strength <eos>
<bos> you have to die a few times before you can reall <eos>
<bos> you have to know what you stand for not just what you stand against <eos>
<bos> you have to love something before you can hate it <eos>
<bos> you have to write the book that wants to be written and if the book will be too difficult for grownups then you write it for children <eos>
<bos> you have your way i have my way as for the right way the correct way and the only way it does not exist <eos>

<bos> you know gabriel said there was a time i thought we could be friends will <eos>
<bos> you know hobbes some days even my lucky rocket ship underpants dont help <eos>
<bos> you know how they say you only hurt the ones you love well it works both ways <eos>
<bos> you know its never fiftyfifty in a marriage its always seventythirty or sixtyforty someone falls in love first someone puts someone else up on a pedestal someone works very hard to keep things rolling smoothly someone else sails along for the ride <eos>
<bos> you know minister i disagree with dumbledore on many countsbut you cannot deny hes got style <eos>
<bos> you know one of the tragedies of real life is that there is no background music <eos>
<bos> you know some people think shadowhunters are just myths like mummies and genies kyle grinned at jace can you grant wishes <eos>
<bos> you know that a good long session of weeping can often make you feel better even if your circumstances have not changed one bit <eos>
<bos> you know the world is going crazy when the best rapper is a white guy the best golfer is a black guy the tallest guy in the nba is chinese the swiss hold the americas cup france is accusing the us of arrogance germany doesnt want to go to war and the three most powerful men in america are named bush dick and colin need i say more <eos>
<bos> you know what charm is a way of getting the answer yes without having asked any clear question <eos>
<bos> you know when it works love is pretty amazing its not overrated theres a reason for all those songs <eos>
<bos> you know you could live a thousand lifetimes and not deserve him <eos>
<bos> you know youre in love when you cant fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams <eos>
<bos> you like someone who cant like you back because unrequited love can be survived in a way that oncerequited love cannot <eos>
<bos> you love me real or not real <eos>
<bos> you may encounter many defeats but you must not be defeated in fact it may be necessary to encounter the defeats so you can know who you are what you can rise from how you can still come out of it <eos>
<bos> you may not control all the events that happen to you but you can decide not to be reduced by them <eos>
<bos> you may say im a dreamer but im not the only one i hope someday youll join us and the world will live as one <eos>
<bos> you might be poor your shoes might be broken but your mind is a palace <eos>
<bos> you might want to lie down magnus advised i find that it helps when the crushing sense of horrible realization sets in <eos>
<bos> you must have chaos within you to give birth to a dancing star <eos>
<bos> you must not lose faith in humanity humanity is like an ocean if a few drops of the ocean are dirty the ocean does not become dirty <eos>
<bos> you must stay drunk on writing so reality cannot destroy you <eos>
<bos> you must write every single day of your life you must lurk in libraries and climb the stacks like ladders to sniff books like perfumes and wear books like hats upon your crazy heads may you be in love every day for the next 20000 days and out of that love remake a world <eos>
<bos> you need to learn how to select your thoughts just the same way you select your clothes every day this is a power you can cultivate if you want to control things in your life so bad work on the mind thats the only thing you should be trying to control <eos>
<bos> you never change your life until you step out of your comfort zone change begins at the end of your comfort zone <eos>
<bos> you never fail until you stop trying <eos>
<bos> you never have to change anything you got up in the middle of the night to write <eos>
<bos> you never know what life is like until you have lived it <eos>
<bos> you never know what worse luck your bad luck has saved you from <eos>
<bos> you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it <eos>
<bos> you only get one life its actually your duty to live it as fully as possible <eos>
<bos> you only live once but if you do it right once is enough <eos>
<bos> you only live twice <eos>
<bos> you pierce my soul i am half agony half hopei have loved none but you <eos>
<bos> you possess other peoplesbodies <eos>
<bos> you realize that our mistrust of the future makes it hard to give up the past <eos>
<bos> you realize that trying to keep your distance from me will not lessen my affection for you all efforts to save me from you will fail <eos>
<bos> you said you were going for a walk what kind of walk takes six hours <eos>
<bos> you see cuckoos are parasites they lay their eggs in other birds nests when the egg hatches the baby cuckoo pushes the other baby birds out of the nest the poor parent birds work themselves to death trying to find enough food to feed the enormous cuckoo child who has murdered their babies and taken their places <eos>
<bos> you see i usually find myself among strangers because i drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me <eos>
<bos> you see things you say why but i dream things that never were and i say why not <eos>
<bos> you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you mad <eos>
<bos> you should date a girl who reads <eos>
<bos> you should never be surprised when someone treats you with respect you should expect it <eos>
<bos> you should write because you love the shape of stories and sentences and the creation of different words on a page writing comes from reading and reading is the finest teacher of how to write <eos>
<bos> you speak an infinite deal of nothing <eos>
<bos> you talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts <eos>
<bos> you think because he doesnt love you that you are worthless you think that because he doesnt want you anymore that he is right that his judgement and opinion of you are correct if he throws you out then you are garbage you think he belongs to you because you want to belong to him dont its a bad word belong especially when you put it with somebody you love love shouldnt be like that did you ever see the way the clouds love a mountain they circle all around it sometimes you cant even see the mountain for the clouds but you know what you go up top and what do you see his head the clouds never cover the head his head pokes through beacuse the clouds let him they dont wrap him up they let him keep his head up high free with nothing to hide him or bind him you cant own a human being you cant lose what you dont own suppose you did own him could you really love somebody who was absolutely nobody without you you really want somebody like that somebody who falls apart when you walk out the door you dont do you and neither does he youre turning over your whole life to him your whole life girl and if it means so little to you that you can just give it away hand it to him then why should it mean any more to him he cant value you more than you value yourself <eos>
<bos> you think my first instinct is to protect you because youre small or a girl or a stiff but youre wrong <eos>
<bos> you think the dead we loved truly ever leave us you think that we dont recall them more clearly in times of great trouble <eos>
<bos> you think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world but then you read <eos>
<bos> you think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world but then you read it was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive who had ever been alive <eos>
<bos> you wanna fly you got to give up the shit that weighs you down <eos>
<bos> you want to know about anybody see what books they read and how theyve been read <eos>
<bos> you were born with wings why prefer to crawl through life <eos>
<bos> you will always be fond of me i represent to you all the sins you never had the courage to commit <eos>
<bos> you will do foolish things but do them with enthusiasm <eos>
<bos> you will find that it is necessary to let things go simply for the reason that they are heavy so let them go let go of them i tie no weights to my ankles <eos>
<bos> you will hear thunder and remember me <eos>
<bos> you will lose what you value most so treasure it while you can <eos>
<bos> you will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of you will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life <eos>
<bos> you yourself as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection <eos>
<bos> youll stay with me <eos>
<bos> your beliefs become your thoughts <eos>
<bos> your emotions are the slaves to your thoughts and you are the slave to your emotions <eos>
<bos> your friends poetry is terrible he said <eos>
<bos> your silence will not protect you <eos>
<bos> your task is not to seek for love but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it <eos>
<bos> youre a guardian angel now i was still too much in awe to wrap my mind around it but at the same time i felt amazement curiosityhappiness <eos>
<bos> youre a painter youre a baker you like to sleep with the windows open you never take sugar in your tea and you always doubleknot your shoelaces <eos>
<bos> youre a prefect oh ronnie thats everyone in the family <eos>
<bos> youre alive only once as far as we know and what could be worse than getting to the end of your life and realizing you hadnt lived it <eos>
<bos> youre an idiot <eos>
<bos> youre beautiful and sad i said finally not looking at him when i did just like your eyes youre like a song that i heard when i was a little kid but forgot i knew until i heard it again for a long moment there was only the whirring sound of the tires on the road and then sam said softly thank you <eos>
<bos> youre going to come across people in your life who will say all the right words at all the right times but in the end its always their actions you should judge them by its actions not words that matter <eos>
<bos> youre just worried theyll hire a male instructor and hell be hotter than you <eos>
<bos> youre not to be so blind with patriotism that you cant face reality wrong is wrong no matter who does it or says it <eos>
<bos> youre off to great places <eos>
<bos> youre something between a dream and a miracle <eos>
<bos> youre still trying to protect me real or not real he whispers <eos>
<bos> youre the first shadowhunter ive ever met <eos>
<bos> youth can not know how age thinks and feels but old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young <eos>
<bos> youth is happy because it has the capacity to see beauty anyone who keeps the ability to see beauty never grows old <eos>
<bos> youve gotta dance like theres nobody watching <eos>
